                                       the facts and circumstances of the case;"
BRIEF FACTS OF THE CASE ARE AS UNDER:-
3.     The case has its genesis in an alleged purchase by Respondent
                       No.2 in November 1993 of 1,600 equity shares of ₹10 each of the
                       Applicant No.1 Company (subsequently subdivided into 16,000
                       shares of ₹1 each) through a stockbroker, Tradeco International. The
                       said shares, along with duly signed transfer deeds, were allegedly
                       lost in transit, leading the Complainant - Respondent No.2 to
                       institute Civil Suit No.451 of 1995 before the learned City Civil
                       Court, Ahmedabad, seeking an injunction restraining the Company
                       from transferring the shares. By order dated 14.07.1995, a permanent
                       injunction was granted. Notably, prior to the suit and the injunction
                       order, 100 of the said shares (post-subdivision, 1,000 shares of ₹1
                       each - "suit shares") had already been transferred on 22.04.1994 to
                       Respondent No.3 on the basis of a transfer deed stamped on

                            R/CR.MA/12605/2013                         ORDER DATED: 06/08/2025

                                                                                                      undefined




                       09.11.1993 and executed on 13.12.1993.
3.1. Subsequent proceedings ensued, including Civil Suit No.2215
                       of 1997 seeking issuance of duplicate shares, which was dismissed
                       for want of jurisdiction. The Complainant thereafter approached the
                       Company Law Board, Western Region Bench, Mumbai, culminating
                       in a consent order dated 10.02.2006 for issuance of 13,000 shares to
                       Respondent No.2, with 1,000 suit shares to remain in the safe
                       custody of the Company pending adjudication of ownership. The
                       petition filed by Respondent No.2 against Respondent No.3 in
                       respect of the suit shares was dismissed by the CLB on 20.06.2007.
                       The Complainant's OJ Appeal No.202 of 2007 before the High
                       Court of Gujarat was withdrawn on 23.08.2012 to enable
                       proceedings before the Bombay High Court, with the interim
                       injunction continuing till 10.09.2012.
3.2. Upon expiry of the interim protection and no further appeal
                       being filed before the Bombay High Court, Respondent No.3 sought
                       release of the suit shares. The Applicant No.1 Company, following
                       due diligence, sought objections from Respondent No.2, who
                       objected while stating that further legal proceedings were being
                       initiated. When directed by the Company on 14.12.2012 to produce
                       an appropriate court order by 31.12.2012 failing which the suit
                       shares would be issued to Respondent No.3, Respondent No.2
                       instead lodged Criminal Case No.1 of 2013 on 01.01.2013 alleging
                       offences under
Sections 406
,
409
,
420
and
120-B
IPC. In the said
                       complaint, process was issued and even a non-bailable warrant came
                       to be passed, leading to the present petition under
Section 482
CrPC
                       for quashing of the criminal proceedings.

                                                                                                       undefined




                       SUBMISSION OF THE PETITIONER:-
4.    Learned advocate for the petitioner submitted that the dispute
                       in question is essentially a private civil dispute between respondent
                       No.2 and respondent No.3. According to the complaint filed by
                       respondent No.2 before the learned Trial Court, he had purchased
                       1,600 equity shares of ₹10 each of Zee Entertainment Enterprises
                       Ltd. & Anr. from open stock market. Subsequently, said shares,
                       which have since appreciated to 16,000 shares due to corporate
                       actions were sent for transfer with duly signed transfer form.
4.1. It was contended that during the course of the transaction, a
                       substantial portion of the shares were lost. Thereafter, a civil suit
                       being Civil Suit No. 451 of 1995 was instituted by the complainant
                       before the City Civil Court, Ahmedabad, seeking an injunction
                       against the transfer of the shares allegedly lost in the transaction.
                       The said court granted an interim injunction in favour of the
                       complainant. In addition, proceedings were also initiated before the
                       Company Law Board, Mumbai, being Company Petition No.
                       21/111A/CLB/WR/2006 for issuance of duplicate share certificates.
4.2. Learned advocate for the petitioner further submitted that a
                       settlement was arrived at between the parties, whereby it was agreed
                       that certain shares would be issued in favour of the petitioner as also
                       to keep 1000 share in abeyance till ownership issue is not resolved.
                       It is submitted that the entirety of the proceedings and documents on
                       record clearly reveal that the dispute, in substance, is of a civil
                       nature, and no element of criminality can be attributed to the
                       petitioner, who is a public limited company, not a party to the
                       original transaction, but merely a issuing company, shares of which
                       were traded by a respondent No.2 and respondent No.3 and now

                                                                                                      undefined




                       become pursuit of dispute.
4.3. It is further submitted that the transaction in question
                       essentially pertains to a commercial transfer of shares between
                       respondent No.2 and respondent No.3. As per the terms of the
                       settlement recorded before the Company Law Board, it was agreed
                       that 14,000 equity shares of ₹1 each would be issued, of which
                       13,000 shares were to be issued to the complainant, and 1,000 shares
                       were retained in custody due to objections raised by Homi Mehta
                       Sons Pvt. Ltd., claiming ownership of the shares. The retention of
                       these shares was subject to adjudication in ongoing litigation.
4.4. The learned advocate for the petitioner further referred to
                       Annexure-D to demonstrate that the petitioner's claim was
                       subsequently denied by the Company Law Board. In nutshell it is
                       argued that petitioner company had not been entrusted any property
                       by the respondent dominance of which lying with petitioner
                       company. He would submit that on going dispute of ownership of
                       share is fairly going between private respondents, which does not
                       attract offence under
Sections 406
and
420
of the IPC.
In support of
                       his submissions, learned advocate placed reliance on the decision of
                       the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Delhi Race Club (1940) Ltd. v.
                       State of Uttar Pradesh
[2024 INSC 626], and accordingly prayed
                       that the present petition be allowed and the impugned criminal
                       proceedings be quashed.
SUBMISSION OF THE RESPONDENTS:-
5.     On the other hand, learned advocate Mr. Dipan Desai for
                       respondent No.2 opposed the submissions advanced on behalf of the
                       petitioner. He took this Court through the sequence of litigation

                       between the parties and submitted that, as per the settlement deed,
                       the complainant was assured the allotment of 14,000 equity shares.
                       However, while 13,000 shares were admittedly issued, the remaining
                       1,000 shares were not allotted by Zee Entertainment Enterprises
                       Ltd., which reneged on the agreed terms.
5.1. It was further submitted that when the complainant approached
                       the Company Law Board seeking appropriate relief, he was
                       informed that his claim was barred by the law of limitation. It is
                       submitted that by settlement deed Zee Entertainment Enterprises
                       Ltd. since agreed to issue 14000 equity shares, fell short to its
                       promise by not issuing 1000 equity share, is an offence attracting
                       criminal breach of trust and cheating. In view of the aforesaid, the
                       learned advocate appearing for respondent No.2 urged that the
                       present petition deserves to be dismissed.
6.    Learned APP for the State while adopting the submissions
                       advanced on behalf of respondent No.2, also prayed for dismissal of
                       the petition.
FINDINGS, ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION OF THE

                                                                                                              undefined




                       7.1. Subsequently, Civil Suit No. 451 of 1995 came to be instituted
                       before the City Civil Court, Ahmedabad by the petitioner. In the said
                       proceedings, none appeared to contest the suit, and in the given facts
                       and circumstances, the Civil Court granted an injunction restraining
                       the transfer of the aforesaid 1,600 equity shares.
7.2. Another suit was unsuccessfully filed by respondent No.2 to
                       get back these shares. This suit is dismissed on the ground of lacking
                       inherent jurisdiction.
7.3. Being so advised, the complainant thereafter approached the
                       Company Law Board, Mumbai. During the proceedings before the
                       Company Law Board, a settlement came to be arrived at between

                       14,000 equity shares of ₹1/- each shall be allotted to the petitioners.
                       Of these, 13,000 shares were to be issued forthwith, whereas the
                       issuance of the remaining 1,000 shares was to be kept in abeyance
                       owing to a dispute regarding their ownership, an objection having
                       been raised by Homi Mehta Sons Pvt. Ltd.

                       Company Law Board has recorded the reasons for bringing the
                       proceedings to a close by dismissing the same, which are reproduced
                       hereinbelow:--
"5. The case of the petitioner in the present petition is that it sent
                               1600 shares (now 16,000 shares)to the Company alongwith the
                               transfer deed for transfer in its name. The said transfer deeds
                               alongwith the share certificates were lost in transit. However, the
                               petitioner was not able to produce any copy of the fiR loda
                               Wanteoice for lost in reque regarding purchase 1600 shares but
                               there is nothing mentioned in the Bill which can show that the
                               petitioner purchased the impugned shares since no distinctive
                               numbers have been mentioned in the Bill. In C.P.No.28/111A/2005
                               filed by the petitioner claiming over 2000 shares a consent term
                               was filed between the petitioner and the Company to settle the
                               dispute amicably. As per the settlement the Company was to issue
                               13,000 shares to the petitioner and the petitioner was to withdraw
                               the suit filed by it at Ahmedabad in the year 1995. As per the
                               settlement the Company issued 13,000 equity shares to the
                               petitioner and the petitioner withdrew all the proceedings against
                               the Company Though the petitioner had claimed that it had
                               purchased the impugned shares in T993 but it failed to file any
                               petition before the CLB under
Sec. 111A
of the Companies Act
                               within three years as provided under
Article 137
of the
Limitation
                               Act
, from that date. The petitioner has also not filed any separate
                               application to condone the delay in filing the present petition. As
                               such I am of the view that the petition is barred by time. The
                               Company has transferred the impugned shares in the year 1994

                               accordingly dismissed and no order to cost."
10. It is noteworthy that, apart from adverting to
Article 137
of the
Limitation Act
, the learned Member of the Company Law Board has
                       also dealt with certain factual aspects while closing the proceedings.
                       In the aforesaid backdrop, the private complaint came to be
                       instituted. Even if the averments made in the said complaint are
                       taken at their face value, they disclose nothing beyond a mere breach
                       of the terms and conditions of the agreement. Such a breach, by
                       itself, does not constitute a criminal offence so as to warrant the
                       invocation of criminal jurisdiction. At the most, it may give rise to
                       civil proceedings -- a remedy which the complainant has, in fact,
                       already pursued.
10.1. It is noticeable that the order passed by Company Law Board
                       has been challenged by filing OJ Appeal No.202 of 2007 before
                       Gujarat High Court. This Court has not entertained petition on the
                       ground of lacking territorial jurisdiction. Petitioner thereafter did not
                       pursue his litigation / remedy elsewhere but chooses to file criminal
                       complaint. According to this Court, by filing criminal complaint,
                       petitioner has converted civil litigation into criminal action. Filing of
                       complaint by the petitioner is hopeless and malicious attempt after
                       loosing dispute at all civil front.
11. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Radheshyam v. State of
                       Rajasthan
, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 2311 observed that breach of
                       terms and conditions of agreement does not attract offence under

Sections 406
and
420
of the IPC, held as under:-
"6. As already indicated above, a perusal of the complaint
                                       which has been registered as the FIR does not spell out any
                                       element or ingredient of cheating or breach of trust. Mere
                                       non-performance of an Agreement to Sell by itself does not
                                       amount to cheating and breach of trust. Respondent no. 2 has
                                       adequate remedy of filing a Civil Suit for relief of specific
                                       performance of a contract which he has already availed and
                                       the suit is still pending. The FIR only appears to be an arm-
                                       twisting mechanism to pressurise the appellants to execute
                                       the Sale Deed or to extract money. Every civil wrong cannot
                                       be converted into a criminal wrong. As we find in the
                                       present case, respondent no. 2 is trying to abuse the criminal
                                       machinery for ulterior motives. It is not his case that the
                                       appellants duped him to pay the advance amount and entered
                                       into an Agreement to Sell. The High Court fell in error in
                                       recording a finding that the ingredients of offences under
sections 420
and
406
of IPC are present in the instant case.
7.
Section 420
, IPC provides that:
"Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person
                                       deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make,
                                       alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security,
                                       or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable
                                       of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished
                                       with imprisonment of either description for a term which
                                       may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine."
For an offence under
Section 420
, IPC, the following
                                       ingredients must be present:
i. Cheating as defined under
Section 415
, IPC, that is, there
                                       should be a fraudulent or dishonest inducement of a person;
                                       ii. An intention to deceive; and
                                       iii. The person cheated must be dishonestly induced to
                                       a. Deliver property to any person; or
                                       b. Make, alter or destroy valuable security or anything
                                       signed or sealed and capable of being converted into
                                       valuable security.

                            R/CR.MA/12605/2013                                ORDER DATED: 06/08/2025

                                                                                                             undefined
8. Thus, cheating forms an essential ingredient to constitute
                                       and offence under
Section 420
, IPC. Further, to constitute
                                       cheating as defined under
Section 415
, IPC, it is necessary
                                       that a fraudulent or dishonest inducement is done and the
                                       deceived person is made to deliver any property owing to the
                                       fraud.
Section 415
, IPC, defines'cheating', as:
"Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or
                                       dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any
                                       property to any person, or to consent that any person shall
                                       retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so
                                       deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do
                                       or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or
                                       omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that
                                       person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to
                                       "cheat"."
9. From the bare perusal of the FIR, it is evident that there
                                       was no act of cheating, that is, the complainant was nowhere
                                       fraudulently induced or dishonestly deceived by the
                                       appellants. A commercial transaction took place between the
                                       parties during which the parties consensually agreed for the
                                       sale of the property of the appellants and respondent no. 2
                                       paid the part consideration. The default in payment of their
                                       loan dues on part of the appellants is not reflective of their
                                       deceitful intention towards the complainant. Mere non-
                                       registration of the sale or its refusal cannot amount to
                                       cheating. The delivery of the advance payment towards
                                       consideration was made in furtherance of an Agreement to
                                       Sell and it is not the case of the respondent that he was in
                                       anyway deceived or duped to make such payments to the
                                       appellants. It is a civil dispute and gives rise to the
                                       complainant's right to resort to the remedies provided under
                                       civil law by filing a suit for specific performance.
10. Additionally, the appellants have also been accused of
                                       committing the offence of criminal breach of trust under
Section 406
, IPC. This offence is defined under
Section 405

                                       IPC as follows:

11. For an offence punishable under
Section 406
, IPC, the
                                       following ingredients must exist:
i. The accused was entrusted with property, or entrusted with
                                       dominion over property;
ii. The accused had dishonestly misappropriated or
                                       converted to their own use that property, or dishonestly used
                                       or disposed of that property or wilfully suffer any other
                                       person to do so; and
                                       iii. Such misappropriation, conversion, use or disposal
                                       should be in violation of any direction of law prescribing the
                                       mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal
                                       contract which the person has made, touching the discharge
                                       of such trust.
12. In the present case, the appellants were not entrusted
                                       with any property by respondent no. 2 - complainant. The
                                       only delivery made was of part payment towards an
                                       Agreement to Sell between the parties. The amount paid
                                       towards consideration cannot be said to have been entrusted
                                       with the appellants by respondent no. 2. Additionally,
                                       merely because the appellants are refusing to register the
                                       sale, it does not amount to misappropriation of the advance
                                       payment. Since there was no entrustment of property, the
                                       offence of misappropriation of such property and thereby
                                       criminal breach of trust cannot be said to be made out."

                                       406
IPC) viz-a-viz the offence of cheating (
Section 420

"9. The ingredients in order to constitute a criminal breach of
                                       trust are: (i) entrusting a person with property or with any
                                       dominion over property, (ii) that person entrusted (a)

                                       made, touching the discharge of such trust.
10. The ingredients of an offence of cheating are: (i) there
                                       should be fraudulent or dishonest inducement of a person by
                                       deceiving him, (ii)(a) the person so deceived should be

                                       that any person shall retain any property; or (b) the person so
                                       deceived should be intentionally induced to do or omit to do
                                       anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so
                                       deceived; and (iii) in cases covered by (ii)(b), the act
                                       of omission should be one which causes or is likely to cause
                                       damage or harm to the person induced in body, mind,
                                       reputation or property."
25. What can be discerned from the above is that the
                                       offences of criminal breach of trust (
Section 406
IPC) and
                                       cheating (
Section 420
IPC) have specific ingredients. In
                                       order to constitute a criminal breach of trust (
Section
                                       406
IPC): -
1) There must be entrustment with person for property or
                                       dominion over the property, and
2) The person entrusted: -

a) dishonestly misappropriated or converted property to his
                                       own use, or
b) dishonestly used or disposed of the property or willfully
                                       suffers any other person so to do in violation of:
i. any direction of law prescribing the method in which the
                                       trust is discharged; or ii. legal contract touching the
                                       discharge of trust (see:
S.W.P. Palanitkar
(supra).
                                       Similarly, in respect of an offence under
Section 420
IPC,
                                       the essential ingredients are: -
1) deception of any person, either by making a false or
                                       misleading representation or by other action or by omission;
2) fraudulently or dishonestly inducing any person to deliver
                                       any property, or
3) the consent that any persons shall retain any property and
                                       finally intentionally inducing that person to do or omit to do
                                       anything which he would not do or omit (see:
Harmanpreet
                                       Singh Ahluwalia v. State of Punjab
, (2009) 7 SCC 712 :
                                       (2009) Cr.L.J. 3462 (SC))
26. Further, in both the aforesaid sections, mens rea i.e.
                                       intention to defraud or the dishonest intention must be
                                       present, and in the case of cheating it must be there from the
                                       very beginning or inception.
27. In our view, the plain reading of the complaint fails to
                                       spell out any of the aforesaid ingredients noted above. We
                                       may only say, with a view to clear a serious misconception
                                       of law in the mind of the police as well as the courts below,
                                       that if it is a case of the complainant that offence of criminal
                                       breach of trust as defined under
Section 405
of IPC,
                                       punishable under
Section 406
of IPC, is committed by the
                                       accused, then in the same breath it cannot be said that the
                                       accused has also committed the offence of cheating as
                                       defined and explained in
Section 415
of the IPC, punishable
                                       under
Section 420
of the IPC.
28. Every act of breach of trust may not result in a penal
                                       offence of criminal breach of trust unless there is evidence of
                                       manipulating act of fraudulent misappropriation. An act of
                                       breach of trust involves a civil wrong in respect of which the

                                       any breach of trust with a mens rea, gives rise to a criminal
                                       prosecution as well. It has been held in
Hari Prasad
                                       Chamaria v. Bishun Kumar Surekha & Ors.
, reported in
                                       (1973) 2 SCC 823 as under:
"4. We have heard Mr. Maheshwari on behalf of the
                                       appellant and are of the opinion that no case has been made
                                       out against the respondents under
Section 420
Penal Code,
                                       1860. For the purpose of the present appeal, we would
                                       assume that the various allegations of fact which have been
                                       made in the complaint by the appellant are correct. Even
                                       after making that allowance, we find that the complaint does
                                       not disclose the commission of any offence on the part of the
                                       respondents under
Section 420
Penal Code, 1860. There is
                                       nothing in the complaint to show that the respondents had
                                       dishonest or fraudulent intention at the time the appellant
                                       parted with Rs. 35.000/- There is also nothing to indicate
                                       that the respondents induced the appellant to pay them Rs.
                                       35,000/- by deceiving him. It is further not the case of the
                                       appellant that a representation was made, the respondents
                                       knew the same to be false. The fact that the respondents
                                       subsequently did not abide by their commitment that they
                                       would show the appellant to be the proprietor of Drang
                                       Transport Corporation and would also render accounts to
                                       him in the month of December might create civil liability on
                                       the respondents for the offence of cheating."
29. To put it in other words, the case of cheating and
                                       dishonest intention starts with the very inception of the
                                       transaction. But in the case of criminal breach of trust, a
                                       person who comes into possession of the movable property
                                       and receives it legally, but illegally retains it or converts it to
                                       his own use against the terms of the contract, then the
                                       question is, in a case like this, whether the retention is with
                                       dishonest intention or not, whether the retention involves
                                       criminal breach of trust or only a civil liability would depend
                                       upon the facts of each case.
30. The distinction between mere breach of contract and the
                                       offence of criminal breach of trust and cheating is a fine one.
                                       In case of cheating, the intention of the accused at the time

                                       of inducement should be looked into which may be judged
                                       by a subsequent conduct, but for this, the subsequent
                                       conduct is not the sole test. Mere breach of contract cannot
                                       give rise to a criminal prosecution for cheating unless
                                       fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right from the
                                       beginning of the transaction i.e. the time when the offence is
                                       said to have been committed. Therefore, it is this intention,
                                       which is the gist of the offence. Whereas, for the criminal
                                       breach of trust, the property must have been entrusted to the
                                       accused or he must have dominion over it. The property in
                                       respect of which the offence of breach of trust has been
                                       committed must be either the property of some person other
                                       than the accused or the beneficial interest in or ownership' of
                                       it must be of some other person. The accused must hold that
                                       property on trust of such other person. Although the offence,
                                       i.e. the offence of breach of trust and cheating involve
                                       dishonest intention, yet they are mutually exclusive and
                                       different in basic concept. There is a distinction between
                                       criminal breach of trust and cheating. For cheating, criminal
                                       intention is necessary at the time of making a false or
                                       misleading representation i.e., since inception. In criminal
                                       breach of trust, mere proof of entrustment is sufficient. Thus,
                                       in case of criminal breach of trust, the offender is lawfully
                                       entrusted with the property, and he dishonestly
                                       misappropriated the same. Whereas, in case of cheating, the
                                       offender fraudulently or dishonestly induces a person by
                                       deceiving him to deliver any property. In such a situation,
                                       both the offences cannot co-exist simultaneously.
31. At the most, the court of the Additional Chief Judicial
                                       Magistrate could have issued process for the offence
                                       punishable under
Section 420
of the IPC i.e. cheating but in
                                       any circumstances no case of criminal breach of trust is
                                       made out. The reason being that indisputably there is no
                                       entrustment of any property in the case at hand. It is not even
                                       the case of the complainant that any property was lawfully
                                       entrusted to the appellants and that the same has been
                                       dishonestly misappropriated. The case of the complainant is
                                       plain and simple. He says that the price of the goods sold by
                                       him has not been paid. Once there is a sale,
Section 406
of
                                       the IPC goes out of picture. According to the complainant,

                                       the invoices raised by him were not cleared. No case worth
                                       the name of cheating is also made out.

                                       cheating the same would have been liable to be quashed and
                                       set aside, as none of the ingredients to constitute the offence
                                       of cheating are disclosed from the materials on record.
33. It has been held in
State of Gujarat v. Jaswantlal
                                       Nathalal
reported in (1968) 2 SCR 408, "The term

                                       words "with the property" immediately following it but also
                                       the words "or with any dominion over the property"
occurring thereafter--see

[(1965) 2 SCR 429]. Before there can be any
                                       entrustment there must be a trust meaning thereby an
                                       obligation annexed to the ownership of property and a
                                       confidence reposed in and accepted by the owner or declared

                                       and the owner.
But that does not mean that such an
                                       entrustment need conform to all the technicalities of the law
                                       of trust -- see
Jaswantrai Manilal Akhaney v. State of
                                       Bombay
[1956 SCR 483]. The expression "entrustment"
carries with it the implication that the person handing over
                                       any property or on whose behalf that property is handed over
                                       to another, continues to be its owner. Further the person
                                       handing over the property must have confidence in the
                                       person taking the property so as to create a fiduciary
                                       relationship between them. A mere transaction of sale cannot
                                       amount to an "entrustment"".
34. Similarly, in
Central Bureau of Investigation, SPE,
                                       SIU(X), New Delhi v. Duncans Agro Industries Ltd.,
                                       Calcutta
reported in (1996) 5 SCC 591 this Court held that
                                       the expression "entrusted with property" used in
Section
                                       405
of the IPC connotes that the property in respect of which
                                       criminal breach of trust can be committed must necessarily
                                       be the property of some person other than the accused or that
                                       the beneficial interest in or ownership thereof must be in the
                                       other person and the offender must hold such property in

                                       trust for such other person or for his benefit. The relevant
                                       observations read as under: -
"27. In the instant case, a serious dispute has been raised by
                                       the learned counsel appearing for the respective parties as to
                                       whether on the face of the allegations, an offence of criminal
                                       breach of trust is constituted or not. In our view, the
                                       expression "entrusted with property" or "with any dominion
                                       over property" has been used in a wide sense in
Section
                                       405
IPC. Such expression includes all cases in which goods
                                       are entrusted, that is, voluntarily handed over for a specific
                                       purpose and dishonestly disposed of in violation of law or in
                                       violation of contract. The expression 'entrusted' appearing
                                       in
Section 405
IPC is not necessarily a term of law. It has
                                       wide and different implications in different contexts. It is,
                                       however, necessary that the ownership or beneficial interest
                                       in the ownership of the property entrusted in respect of
                                       which offence is alleged to have been committed must be in
                                       some person other than the accused and the latter must hold
                                       it on account of some person or in some way for his benefit.
                                       The expression 'trust' in
Section 405
IPC is a
                                       comprehensive expression and has been used to denote
                                       various kinds of relationships like the relationship of trustee
                                       and beneficiary, bailor and bailee, master and servant,
                                       pledger and pledgee. When some goods are hypothecated by
                                       a person to another person, the ownership of the goods still
                                       remains with the person who has hypothecated such goods.
                                       The property in respect of which criminal breach of trust can
                                       be committed must necessarily be the property of some
                                       person other than the accused or the beneficial interest in or
                                       ownership of it must be in the other person and the offender
                                       must hold such property in trust for such other person or for
                                       his benefit. In a case of pledge, the pledged article belongs to
                                       some other person but the same is kept in trust by the
                                       pledgee. [...]" (Emphasis supplied)
35. The aforesaid exposition of law makes it clear that there
                                       should be some entrustment of property to the accused
                                       wherein the ownership is not transferred to the accused. In
                                       case of sale of movable property, although the payment may
                                       be deferred yet the property in the goods passes on delivery

and
24
respectively of the
Sale of Goods
                                       Act, 1930
.
"20. Specific goods in a deliverable state. -- Where there is
                                       an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a
                                       deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the
                                       buyer when the contract is made and it is immaterial whether
                                       the time of payment of the price or the time of delivery of
                                       goods, or both, is postponed.

24. Goods sent on approval or "on sale or return". -- When
                                       goods are delivered to the buyer on approval or "on sale or
                                       return" or other similar terms, the property therein passes to
                                       the buyer--(a) when he signifies his approval or acceptance
                                       to the seller or does any other act adopting the transaction;
(b) if he does not signify his approval or acceptance to the
                                       seller but retains the goods without giving notice of
                                       rejection, then, if a time has been fixed for the return of the
                                       goods on the expiration of such time, and, if no time has
                                       been fixed, on the expiration of a reasonable time."
36. From the aforesaid, there is no manner of any doubt
                                       whatsoever that in case of sale of goods, the property passes
                                       to the purchaser from the seller when the goods are
                                       delivered. Once the property in the goods passes to the
                                       purchaser, it cannot be said that the purchaser was entrusted
                                       with the property of the seller. Without entrustment of
                                       property, there cannot be any criminal breach of trust. Thus,
                                       prosecution of cases on charge of criminal breach of trust,
                                       for failure to pay the consideration amount in case of sale of
                                       goods is flawed to the core. There can be civil remedy for
                                       the non-payment of the consideration amount, but no
                                       criminal case will be maintainable for it. [See :

38. If it is the case of the complainant that a particular
                                       amount is due and payable to him then he should have filed a
                                       civil suit for recovery of the amount against the appellants
                                       herein. But he could not have gone to the court of Additional
                                       Chief Judicial Magistrate by filing a complaint of cheating
                                       and criminal breach of trust.
39. It appears that till this date, the complainant has not filed
                                       any civil suit for recovery of the amount which according to
                                       him is due and payable to him by the appellants. He seems to
                                       have prima facie lost the period of limitation for filing such a
                                       civil suit.
40. In such circumstances referred to above, the continuation
                                       of the criminal proceeding would be nothing but abuse of the
                                       process of law.
41. Before we close this matter, we would like to say
                                       something as regards the casual approach of the courts
                                       below in cases like the one at hand. The
Indian Penal
                                       Code
(
IPC
) was the official Criminal Code in the Republic
                                       of India inherited from the British India after independence.
                                       The
IPC
came into force in the sub-continent during the
                                       British rule in 1862. The
IPC
remained in force for almost a
                                       period of 162 years until it was repealed and replaced by the
                                       Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita ("BNS") in December 2023 which
                                       came into effect on 1st July 2024. It is indeed very sad to
                                       note that even after these many years, the courts have not
                                       been able to understand the fine distinction between criminal
                                       breach of trust and cheating."
13. In the recent judgment in the case of Ashok kumar Jain v/s.
                       State of Gujarat [SLP Criminal No.1850 of 2020] while
                       discussing the essential ingredients of offence under
Section 406
,
420
of the IPC, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as under:-
9.1 This court, while discussing the expression "entrustment" in
Rashmi Kumar v. Mahesh Kumar Bhada
; (1997) 2 SCC 397,
                               observed that it carries with it the implication that the person
                               handing over any property or on whose behalf that property is
                               handed over to another, continues to be its owner. Entrustment is

                               not necessarily a term of law. It may have different implications in
                               different contexts. In its most general significance, all its imports is
                               handing over the possession for some purpose which may not
                               imply the conferment of any proprietary right therein. The
                               ownership or beneficial interest in the property in respect of which
                               criminal breach of trust is alleged to have been committed, must be
                               in some person other than the accused and the latter must hold it on
                               account of some person or in some way for his benefit.
9.2 Further, in
Hridaya Ranjan Prasad Verma v. State of Bihar
;
(2000) 4 SCC 168, this court observed as follows:
"15. In determining the question it has to be kept in mind that
                                   the distinction between mere breach of contract and the offence
                                   of cheating is a fine one. It depends upon the intention of the
                                   accused at the time of inducement which may be judged by his
                                   subsequent conduct but for this subsequent conduct is not the
                                   sole test. Mere breach of contract cannot give rise to criminal
                                   prosecution for cheating unless fraudulent or dishonest intention
                                   is shown right at
                                   the beginning of the transaction, that is the time when the
                                   offence is said to have been committed. Therefore it is the
                                   intention which is the gist of the offence. To hold a person
                                   guilty of cheating it is necessary to show that he had fraudulent
                                   or dishonest intention at the time of making the promise. From
                                   his mere failure to keep up promise subsequently such a
                                   culpable intention right at the beginning, that is, when he made
                                   the promise cannot be
                                   presumed."

                               as follows:

                            R/CR.MA/12605/2013                                ORDER DATED: 06/08/2025

                                                                                                             undefined




                               16.1.1. The person so induced should be intentionally induced to
                               deliver any property to any person or to consent that any person
                               shall retain any property, or

                               16.1.2. The person so induced should be intentionally induced to
                               do or to omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he
                               were not so deceived; and

                               16.2. In cases covered by 16.1.2. above, the act or omission should
                               be one which caused or is likely to cause damage or harm to the
                               person induced in body, mind, reputation or property.
17. A fraudulent or dishonest inducement is an essential ingredient
                               of the offence. A person who dishonestly induces another person to
                               deliver any property is liable for the offence of cheating.
18.                              xxx xxx xxx
19. The ingredients to constitute an offence under
Section 420
are
                               as follows:
19.1 A person must commit the offence of cheating under
                               Section 415; and

                               19.2 The person cheated must be dishonestly induced to:
(a) deliver property to any person; or
(b) make, alter or destroy valuable security or anything
                               signed or sealed and capable of being converted into
                               valuable security."
(Emphasis supplied)
14. Applying the ratio aforesaid what could be noticed that the
                       complainant lost the battle on civil side now chooses to fight the
                       battle on a criminal side against the petitioner. It is a vexatious
                       attempt on the part of the complainant to convert the civil litigation
                       into criminal litigation by filing a criminal complaint.
