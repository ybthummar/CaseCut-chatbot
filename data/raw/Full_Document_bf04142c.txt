                              ORDER
[ Crl.MC.3584/2020, Crl.MC.3589/2020, Crl.MC.3592/2020,
    Crl.MC.3611/2020, Crl.MC.3612/2020, Crl.MC.3616/2020,

          Dated this the 5th day of November 2020

     These criminal miscellaneous cases are filed by the accused

in eight different cases. This Court as per common order dated

16.03.2020 directed the learned Magistrate to dispose all these

cases within a period of 40 days. The grievance of the petitioners

is that even now the learned Magistrate has not complied the

order. The further grievance of the petitioners is that the

petitioners are foreigners and they are in jail for about 2 to 4

years. These Criminal Miscellaneous Cases are filed to direct the

learned   Magistrate   to   comply   the   common     order   dated

16.03.2020 in Crl.M.C.No.2070 of 2020 and other connected

cases.
2.    The learned counsel for the petitioners aregued the

matter in detail. They submitted their grievance. According to the

counsel, the petitioners are in jail for the last 2 to 4 years. The

counsel submitted that the trial is not completed. The learned

Magistrate even flouted the directions of this court. Therefore, the

counsel submitted that there may be a further direction to
 Crl.MC.No.3584/2020 & Conn. Cases
16
implement the earlier order.
3.   I cannot accept the above contention. This Court

cannot issue a direction to implement an order already passed by

this Court in another case invoking the powers under
Section 482
of the Cr.P.C.   I feel that there is a genuine grievance to the

petitioners that their case is not disposed of and they are in jail.

The remedy of the petitioners is to file a petition in the disposed

cases informing this court that the learned Magistrate has not

complied the order.
Therefore, these Criminal Miscellaneous Cases are closed

with liberty to the petitioners to approach this Court with a

petition reporting that the learned Magistrate has not complied

the judgment dated 16.03.2020 in Crl.M.C.No.2070 of 2020 and

other connected cases.
