                                             COMMON ORDER
The petitioner in all these writ petitions is one and the same

                     challenging the Government Orders issued by the second respondent on the

                     grounds of abuse of process of law, unconstitutional and illegal, as it affects

                     the petitioner's right to freedom of speech and expression.
2. The petitioner is the Printer, Publisher and Editor of the

                     Tamil Daily "Murasoli", which is a reputed Tamil Daily Newspaper

                     publication known for its honest and ethical reporting, widely read across

                     the Country for more than 50 years. It is stated that the second respondent

                     claiming that the news items published in Tamil Daily "Murasoli" are

                     defamatory and allegedly punishable under
Sections 500
and
501
of the

                     Indian Penal Code, issued various Government Orders authorizing the third

                     respondent herein to file defamation complaints against the petitioner and

                     Thiru M.Karunanidhi, Author of "Murasoli", for authoring and publishing

                     various news items in Tamil daily "Murasoli" on various titles viz.,

                     "fiy"h;      gjpy;fs;" and       "fiy"h;          fojk;"         on     various       dates.
Subsequently, complaints were filed before the Principal Sessions Court,

                     Chennai, against the petitioner and Thiru M.Karunanidhi and summons

                     were issued for their appearance and defend themselves for the alleged

                     offences under
Sections 500
and
501
of the Indian Penal Code. Challenging

                     the said Government Orders, the petitioner is before this Court.
3. According to the petitioner, everyone has a fundamental

                     right to form his opinion on any issue of general concern and every citizen

                     can form and inform the others the opinion he has, a democracy is based on

                     free debate and open discussions. Further,
Sections 500
and
501
of the

                     Indian Penal Code run contrary to the guarantee of free speech in a

                     democratic country like India. Challenging the said Government Orders,

                     the petitioner is before this Court.
4. Heard the submissions made on either side and perused the

                     materials available on record.
5. Today when the matters are taken up for final hearing, the

                     learned Additional Government Pleader would submit that the State

                     Government has already issued Press Release No.518, dated 29.07.2021,

                     wherein the Government of Tamilnadu has taken a decision to drop all the

                     cases filed in this regard.
6. In a similar circumstance, this Court has already passed an

                     order in W.P.No.5129 of 2012, etc. batch, dated 21.05.2022. The relevant

                     paragraphs of the said order are extracted as follows:-
"49. State is like a parent for all citizens in so far as Defamation
                                  law is concerned. It is normal for some parents to face vituperative
                                  insults from their children. Despite those insults, parents don’t disown
                                  their children quite easily. They always have the hope that their
                                  children will mend themselves in the near future. Only in rarest of rare
                                  cases when the character and behaviour of their children is
                                  irretrievably broken down and irreconcilable, the parents disown them.
                                  The attitude of the State with regard to defamation must also be the
                                  same as their tolerance level towards its citizens in so far as defamation
                                  is concerned must be akin to that of parents. When the state is having
                                  other avenues under law to make the offender realise the mistake if
                                  any, the criminal defamation law under
section 499
and
500
IPC
                                  should be sparingly used by the State. An individual or a public
                                  servant/constitutional functionary can be impulsive but not the State
                                  which will have to show utmost restraint and maturity in filing criminal
                                  defamation cases. If the State becomes an impulsive prosecutor in
                                  criminal defamation matters that too in an era of social media where

                                  there are scores of abusive contents made against public figures, the
                                  Sessions Court will get clogged with innumerable matters which are
                                  sometimes vindictive in nature only to settle scores with opposition
                                  political parties. The intention of the legislature would never have been
                                  for this unlawful object.
50. The State must be fully convinced based on the materials
                                  that the ingredients of criminal defamation under
section 499
IPC have
                                  been fully satisfied and the act committed by the alleged offender does
                                  not come within any of the many exceptions contained in
section 499
IPC. This Court obtained from the registry of this Court statistics of the
                                  cases filed under
section 199(2)
Cr.P.C. through the public prosecutor
                                  of Tamil Nadu in the State of Tamilnadu from the year 2012 to 2020
                                  and finds a slew of cases filed totally numbering 226 cases are pending
                                  on the file of various Sessions courts till date. Even as seen from these
                                  batch of writ petitions, within a short period, the State has filed a slew
                                  of Criminal defamation cases. As seen from the data, irrespective of
                                  political party who is in power, cases under
section 199(2)
Cr.P.C. have
                                  been filed. In many cases, the High Court has stayed the prosecution.
                                  Due to the mechanical filing of complaints under
section 199(2)
Cr.P.C., the Sessions Courts are sometimes clogged with those matters
                                  due to reckless filing without application of mind and sometimes
                                  vindictively. This menace will have to be curbed and nipped in the bud.
                                  The Criminal defamation law is meant for a laudable object in real
                                  cases of necessity and cannot be misused by using the State as a tool to
                                  settle scores of a public servant/constitutional functionary over his/her
                                  adversary. A public servant/constitutional functionary must be able to
                                  face criticism. As public servants/constitutional functionaries, they owe

                                  a solemn duty to the people. The state cannot use criminal defamation
                                  cases to throttle democracy.
51. In criminal defamation cases, police cannot register FIR
                                  under
section 499
IPC against the accused. Only through a complaint
                                  under
section 199
Cr.P.C., the defamer can be prosecuted. The level of
                                  scrutiny by a Sessions Judge/Magistrate before taking cognizance of
                                  criminal defamation cases under
section 499
IPC is more stringent and
                                  painstaking as there is no police report/charge sheet available as in the
                                  case of cognizable offences where the Police Officer submits an
                                  investigation report under
section 173 (3)
of Cr.P.C. to the Learned
                                  Magistrate. The legislature has tightened the screws in so far as
                                  criminal defamation cases filed through a public prosecutor under
section 199(2)
Cr.P.C. are concerned to avoid any abuse or misuse of
                                  the said provision.
52. Insofar as the role of the public prosecutor is concerned,
                                  Bairam Muralidhar's case rendered by the Hon’ble Supreme referred
                                  to supra has made it clear that a public prosecutor cannot act like a
                                  mere post office but should independently apply his mind before
                                  prosecuting the criminal complaint and he should also be fair to the
                                  court.
53. In the considered view of this court, following are the basic
                                  requirements of a Public Prosecutor:
a) A Public prosecutor must consider himself/herself as an
                                  agent of justice.
b) There should not be on the part of the public prosecutor a

                                  blind eagerness for, or grasping at a conviction.
c) The prosecution of the accused persons has to be conducted
                                  with utmost fairness. In undertaking the prosecution, the State is not
                                  actuated by any motives of revenge but seeks only to protect the
                                  community. There should not therefore be seemly eagerness for, or
                                  grasping at a conviction.
d) A public prosecutor should not by statement aggravate the
                                  case against the accused, or keep back a witness because his/her
                                  evidence may weaken the case of the prosecution.
e) A public prosecutor should place before the Court whatever
                                  evidence is in his/her possession.
f) A public prosecutor should discharge his/her duties fairly and
                                  fearlessly and with full sense of responsibility that attaches to his/her
                                  position.
g) Prosecution does not mean persecution.
54. In defamation cases filed under
Section 199(2)
Cr.P.C., the
                                  public prosecutor plays a very vital role. The role is very special
                                  because in those matters, the public prosecutor plays a dual role both
                                  as a person representing the public servant/constitutional functionary
                                  as well as a public prosecutor. Therefore, the cardinal principles
                                  mentioned supra will have to be strictly adhered to by the public
                                  prosecutor while filing complaints under section 199(2) Cr.P.C.
55. The Sessions Court before taking cognizance of a complaint
                                  filed under
section 199(2)
Cr.P.C. has to apply its judicial mind to the
                                  materials available on record and only if it is satisfied that ingredients
                                  for taking cognizance under
Section 199(2)
has been made out, shall

                                  take cognizance and issue summons to the accused. When a specific
                                  procedure is contemplated under
section 200
Cr.P.C., it cannot be
                                  deviated by adopting some other procedure which is not prescribed,
                                  even though it may be convenient to the complainant. The purpose of
                                  recording the substance of sworn statement by the Magistrate/Sessions
                                  Judge is to enable the Magistrate/Sessions judge to satisfy himself of
                                  the allegation in the complaint to proceed further in the matter and
                                  also put the accused on notice about the allegations.
56. This Court having elaborately considered and narrated the
                                  criminal defamation law and the freedom of speech and expression
                                  provided under
Article 19(1)
of the Constitution of India shall now
                                  consider the merits of each of the writ petitions separately. In all the
                                  cases, the core ingredient required for prosecution through a public
                                  prosecutor under
section 199(2)
Cr.P.C. namely “Defamation of the
                                  State” is missing. In all the matters, while granting sanction for
                                  prosecution to a public prosecutor, the respective sanction orders are
                                  totally silent as to whether the state has been defamed on account of the
                                  alleged defamation of the public servant/constitutional functionary
                                  while discharging his/her public functions. It has been made crystal
                                  clear by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in KK Mishra’s case as well as in
                                  P.C Joshi’s case referred to supra that prosecution under
section
                                  199(2)
Cr.P.C. is on account of defamation against the State.
57. As laid down by various decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme
                                  Court as well as the High courts, before granting sanction for
                                  prosecution, the competent authority of the State shall have to apply its
                                  mind to the materials and should be satisfied with the same and only
10/14
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
                                                                 W.P.Nos.27705 & 27706 of 2012, 12608, 12609 & 12610 of 2013


                                  thereafter should sanction prosecution. As observed earlier, in all the
                                  cases which are the subject matter of consideration by this court, the
                                  State has sanctioned prosecution in a mechanical fashion by total non
                                  application of mind as the fundamental requirement for prosecution
                                  under
section 199(2)
Cr.P.C. namely “Defamation of the State” does
                                  not find a place in all the sanction orders. The public prosecutor as well
                                  as the Sessions Judge in cases where cognizance has already been
                                  taken by the Sessions Court have also not applied their mind
                                  independently as the core essence of prosecution under
section 199 (2)
Cr.P.C. namely “Defamation of the state” has not been satisfied as seen
                                  from the sanction orders. On this score alone, all the Government
                                  Orders and the consequential complaints for criminal defamation
                                  under
section 199(2)
Cr.P.C. will have to fail.
58. The pleadings in the respective complaints also does not
                                  spell out any defamation of the State. The Public Prosecutor or any
                                  other witness has also not been examined as a witness and given their
                                  sworn statement before the Sessions Court which is mandatory under
Section 200
Cr.P.C. The Sessions Court has also in a mechanical
                                  fashion by total non application of its judicial mind and without
                                  detailing the materials it had scrutinized has taken cognizance and
                                  issued process to the accused. All these factors will conclusively infer
                                  abuse of process of law against the respective accused and hence, all
                                  the sanction orders as well as the corresponding complaints filed under
Section 199(2)
will have to be necessarily quashed.
59. These batch of writ petitions involve some cases where on
                                  the face of it, a conclusive inference can be made that no Criminal

                                  Defamation whatsoever has been made out. However, in respect of
                                  other cases, the accused can be prosecuted for criminal defamation
                                  under
section 199(6)
Cr.P.C. before the Magistrate but not under
Section 199(2)
Cr.P.C. before the Sessions Court as no “Defamation
                                  against the state” has been made out or projected to by the State in its
                                  sanction orders or in the respective Complaints. This court shall now
                                  individually deal with each of the writ petitions which are the subject
                                  matter of consideration and segregate them into cases where there is no
                                  defamation at all and cases where defamation may fall under
section
                                  199(6)
Cr.P.C. to prevent any further abuse against the Petitioners
                                  against whom no criminal defamation whatsoever has been made out.
7. This Court is also inclined to follow the same order passed

                     in the above-mentioned Writ Petition and accordingly, these Writ Petitions

                     are allowed. There shall be no order as to costs. Consequently, connected

                     Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.
