no.                   Date of Decision: 24.07.2013
The petitioners, who stand convicted in the appeal for the FIR captioned above, has
come up before this Court under
Section 401
Cr.P.C. for setting aside judgment of conviction
and order of sentence dated 24.07.2013, and the FIR, based on the compromise with the
victim.
2.    The gist of the allegations against the petitioners is of cheating and forgery.
3.    The petitioners and the victim (deceased through his LR/son Rattan Singh) have entered
into an out of Court compromise. They have annexed the copy of the compromise with
application for compounding of offence which was arrived at before the Mediation Centre on
09.05.2018

CRR No.2594 of 2013                                                                 --2--
Court's report dated 26.08.2022, the victim's LR Rattan Singh, without any threat, consented
to the quashing of FIR and consequent proceedings i.e. judgment of conviction and sentence
order.
ANALYSIS & REASONING:
6.    Despite the severe opposition of the State's counsel to this compromise, the following
aspects would be relevant to conclude this petition: -
a)     The accused and the private respondent(s) have amicably settled the matter
             between them in terms of the compromise deed and the statements recorded
             before the concerned Court;
b)     A perusal of the documents reveal that the settlement has not been secured
             through coercion, threats, social boycotts, bribes, or other dubious means;
c)     The victim has willingly consented to the nullification of criminal proceedings;
d)     There is no objection from the private respondents in case present FIR and
             consequent proceedings are quashed;
e)     In the given facts, the occurrence does not affect public peace or tranquillity, moral
             turpitude or harm the social and moral fabric of the society or involve matters
             concerning public policy;
f)The rejection of compromise may also lead to ill will. The pendency of trial affects
             career and happiness;
g)     There is nothing on the record to prima facie consider the accused as an
             unscrupulous, incorrigible, and professional offender;
h)     The purpose of criminal jurisprudence is reformatory in nature and to work to
             bring peace to family, and society;
i)      The exercise of the inherent power for quashing the conviction, sentence and all
             previous proceedings are justified to secure the ends of justice.
7.       When the parties have buried their hatchets, the continuation of criminal proceedings
will not advance the reformative purposes of jurisprudence just for the sake of deterrence and
the trial would be futile exercise resulting in loss of material time and resources as the victims
are likely to not support the case of prosecution further. This is a fit case to exercise revisional
as well as inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
8.    In the present case, the offences under
sections 467
,
468
and
471
of Indian Penal Code,
1860 (
IPC
) are not compoundable under
Section 320
of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
(
Cr.P.C
.). However, in the facts and circumstances peculiar to this case, the prosecution qua the
non-compoundable offences can be closed by quashing the FIR and consequent proceedings.
JUDICIAL PRECEDENTS ON QUASHING OF CONVICTION BASED ON COMPROMISE:
9.   In Ram Pujan and ors. v. State of U.P., 1973 AIR(SC) 2418, a three-judge bench of Hon'ble


                                           2 of 10

CRR No.2594 of 2013                                                                 --3--
Supreme Court, based on the post-conviction compromise reduced the sentence under
section 326
IPC to that of already undergone.
10.   In Ram Prasad and Another v. State of Uttar Pardesh, Cr.A Nos. 308-309 of 1980, decided
on April 21, 1980, Hon'ble Supreme Court converted the conviction from 307
IPC
to 324
IPC
and after that based on compromise, accepted the compounding of offence under
section 324
IPC and acquitted the appellants.
11.
In
Ramji Lal v. State of Haryana
, (1983) 1 SCC 368, Hon'ble Supreme Court, in a matter
arising against the conviction under
section 325
IPC, held,
           [5]. All the offences for which the appellants are convicted are
           compoundable and the compromise can be entered into with the
           permission of the court. Looking to the chastened attitude of the
           accused and the commendable attitude of the injured complainant,
           in order to restore harmony in the society, we accept the
           compromise. We grant permission to enter into the compromise and
           accept the same. We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the
           conviction and sentence imposed on both the appellants. If they are
           on bail, their bail-bonds will be cancelled. If they are in jail, they will
           be released from the jail forthwith.
12.
In
Mohd. Rafi v. State of U.P.
, 1998(2) R.C.R.(Criminal) 455, Supreme Court, the convict
had gone to Hon'ble Supreme Court against his conviction by the trial Court under
Sections
323
and
325
of IPC, which was upheld by Sessions and High Court. After that, the convict and
the victim entered into an out-of-court compromise. Hon'ble Supreme Court analyzed the
parties' affidavits filed in support of the compromise and observed that parties had willingly
and voluntarily settled the matter. To maintain good relations, Hon'ble Supreme Court granted
permission to them to compound the said offenses and order the acquittal.
13.
In
Surendra Nath Mohanty and another Vs. State of Orissa
, 1999 5 SCC 238. These
decisions indicate that the effect of compromise after conviction for a non-compoundable
offence has to be taken into consideration only for the purpose of reducing the sentence and
not for setting aside the conviction on that count.
14.   In Parameswari v. Vennila, (2000) 10 SCC 348, the appellants before Hon'ble Supreme
Court had been convicted under
Section 494
read with
Section 109
of IPC. After that, they
arrived at a settlement with the complainant, in the presence of panchayatdars of their village,
and placed on record the duly signed compromise, and parties filed a joint application for
permission to compound the offences. While observing that the offence involved was
compoundable with the wife's consent and permission of the Court, Hon'ble Supreme Court
granted permission to compound the offence, and resultantly the appellants stood acquitted
of the offence for which they have been held guilty.
15.   In M.D. Balal Mian v. State of Bihar, 2001 AIR (SCW) 5190, out of three convicts, one was


                                          3 of 10

CRR No.2594 of 2013                                                                  --4--
convicted under
Section 376
IPC, and the other two were convicted only under
Sections 325
&
323
of IPC. After the High Court confirmed the conviction and sentence, all three convicts
approached Hon'ble Supreme Court. Although Hon'ble Supreme Court did not find any scope
for granting special leave by the convict challenging his conviction under
section 376
IPC,
however, granted the other permission to the other two convicts to compound the offences
under
Section 320 (8)
of the Criminal Procedure Code and acquitted both of them.
16.
In
Vuyyuru Ramachandra Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh
, 2001 AIR (SCW) 2396, the
appellant had approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court against upholding the conviction under
section 354
IPC. The victim of molestation came to terms with the convict and applied to
compound the offence. Hon'ble Supreme Court allowed such application for compounding and
resultantly acquitted the appellant under
Section 320 (8)
of the Criminal Procedure Code.
17.
In
Ramachandra Singh v. State of Bihar
, 2003(10) SCC 234, Hon'ble Supreme Court
holds:
[5]. We have heard learned counsel for the appellants and the state
              and taken into, consideration the fact and circumstances of the case.
              In view of the compromise it appears that grievance, if any, of the
              complainant Kamlesh Kumari Devi is over. Indeed in view of the
              compromise the accused appellants stand acquitted of the offence
              under
Section 323
Indian Penal Code. In such circumstances the
              sentence passed by the trial Court and maintained by the High Court
              deserves to be modified so far as offence under
Section 498A
Indian
              Penal Code is concerned.
[6]. The appeal is partly allowed. The conviction of appellant Nos. 1
              and 2 under
Section 498A
Indian Penal Code is maintained, but the
              sentence of imprisonment passed on them for offence under
Section
              498-A
is reduced to the period already undergone. In so far as
              appellant No. 3 is concerned, in our opinion, it will meet the ends of
              justice if he is dealt with under
Section 4
of the Probation of
              Offenders Act, 1958, and released on probation of good conduct. The
              sentence of imprisonment passed on appellant No. 3 is set aside and
              it is directed that he shall be released on his entering into a bond with
              one surety in an amount of Rs. 5000/- to appear before the trial Court
              and receive sentence on being called upon during a period of one
              year and in the meantime to keep the peace and be of good
              behaviour.
18.
In
K. Kandasamy v. K.P.M.V.P. Chandrasekaran
, (2005) 4 SCC 349, based on the
compromise, Hon'ble Supreme Court acquitted the appellants/convicts of the offence under
Section 500
Indian Penal Code.
19.   In Khursheed and others v. State of U.P, Appeal (crl.) 1302 of 2007, decided on 28-9-
2007, the appellants were convicted by Trial Court under sections 325, 323 read with 34
IPC
.
Their appeal against conviction was dismissed by the Sessions Court and revision petition was
also dismissed by High Court. The convicts approached the Apex Court and Hon'ble Supreme
Court held,


                                            4 of 10

CRR No.2594 of 2013                                                              --5--
[12]. An offence of causing grievous hurt punishable under
Section
           325
IPC is covered by sub- section (2) of Section 320 of the Code. It is
           thus clear that an offence punishable under
Section 325
IPC is also
           compounded with the permission of the Court.
[13]. The parties have compounded the offences. As stated in the
           compromise deed, Gurfan Ahmad, complainant and his mother
           Kulsoom @ Bhoori (injured) did not want any action against the
           appellants (accused). The parties are neighbours, their houses are
           situated adjacent to each other and they have been living peacefully
           for last many years and there is no dispute among them. It is further
           stated that to continue sweet relationship and harmony, complainant
           side does not want to take any action against the accused. A prayer is,
           therefore, made to accept the compromise.
[14]. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, and
           considering the Deed of Compromise and having heard learned
           counsel for the parties, in our opinion, ends of justice would be met if
           we grant necessary permission for compounding an offence
           punishable under Section 325 read with
Section 34
IPC as required by
           sub-section (2) of Section 320 of the Code. The offence punishable
           under
Section 323
IPC has already been compounded by the parties.
           [15]. Sub-section (8) of Section 320 states that the compounding of
           offence under the section shall have an effect of acquittal of the
           accused with whom the offence has been compounded. The resultant
           effect of compounding of offences would be that the accused should
           be acquitted. In other words, once the offences have been
           compounded and the requisite permission is granted by the Court,
           the accused must be acquitted.
20.     In Dr. Arvind Barsaul etc. v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2008) 5 SCC 794, after the
conviction under
section 498-A
IPC, the victim wife and the convict husband had compromised
their disputes, and sought setting aside of conviction based on the compromise. Hon'ble
Supreme Court holds as follows,
           [10]. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length. The parties
           have compromised and the complainant Smt. SadhnaMadnawat
           categorically submitted that she does not want to prosecute the appellants.
           Even otherwise also, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and
           in the interest of justice, in our opinion, continuation of criminal
           proceedings would be an abuse of the process of law. We, in exercise of our
           power under
Article 142
of the Constitution, deem it proper to quash the
           criminal proceedings pending against the appellants emanating from the
           FIR lodged under
section 498A
Indian Penal Code. The appeal is accordingly
           disposed of.
21.
In
Manoj &Anr. v. State of Madhya Pradesh, Cr. A No.
1530 of 2008, Hon'ble Supreme
Court, based on compromise, accepted the compounding of the offence under
section 324
IPC
and acquitted the appellants.

In
Md. Abdul SufanLaskar v. State of Assam
, (2008) 9 SCC 333, based on a compromise,
Hon'ble Supreme Court set aside the conviction and sentence under

Hon'ble
Supreme Court took similar views in

In
C.Muniappan Vs. State of Tamil Nadu
, 2009 13 SCC 790, after the conviction and
sentence under
section 302
IPC, the deceased's family had compromised the matter with the
accused. Rejecting the compromise, Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that once the parties
have settled their disputes, they could live in peace, but that cannot be a ground to pass a
judgment of acquittal.
24.    In Gampa Govindu v. State of Andhra Pradesh, Law Finder Doc Id # 521064; 2008(1)
OriLR839, Hon'ble Supreme Court holds,
           [3]. The Trial Court convicted the sole appellant under
Section 326
of
           the Indian Penal Code [hereinafter referred to as "
I.P.C
."] and
           sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three
           years and to pay fine of Rupees one thousand; in default, to undergo
           further simple imprisonment for a period of one month. On appeal
           being preferred, the Sessions Court confirmed the conviction and
           sentence. When the matter was taken to the High Court in revision,
           the conviction and sentence under
Section 326
I.P.C. have been set
           aside and the appellant has been convicted under
Section 324
I.P.C.
           and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one
           year. Before this Court, a joint petition of compromise has been filed
           wherein it has been stated that the parties have settled their
           disputes; as such, they be permitted to compound the offence. In our
           view, the prayer is just and must be granted. Accordingly, the criminal
           appeal is allowed and the conviction and sentence awarded against
           the appellant are set aside, in view of the compounding.
25.
In
Hirabhai Jhaverbhai v. State of Gujarat
, (2010) 6 SCC 688, permitting the parties to
compromise the conviction under
section 324
IPC, Hon'ble Supreme Court holds, "The injured
complainant and two other injured are permitted to compound the offence punishable under
Section 324
Indian Penal Code. In view of sub-section (8) of
Section 320
of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, the composition of offence under
section 324
Indian Penal Code shall
have the effect of an acquittal of the appellant with whom the offence has been
compounded."
26.
In
Surat Singh v. State of Uttaranchal (Now Uttarakhand
), 2012(12) SCC 772, Hon'ble
Supreme Court, based on compromise, permitted the parties to compound their offences
under
section 354
and
506
IPC.
27.
In
Jeetu Vs. State of Chhattisgarh
, 2013 11 SCC 489 it is the duty of the appellate Court to
arrive at its own independent conclusion after examining the material on record. This exercise
has however to be conducted after considering the material on record. There is no power
conferred by the Code either on the appellate Court/revisional Court to acquit an accused
convicted for a commission of a non-compoundable offence only on the ground that
compromise has been entered into between the convict and the informant/complainant.

29.
In
Padmalayan v. Sarasan
, (2014) 13 SCC 798, Hon'ble Supreme Court permitted post-
conviction compromise for offence under
section 324
IPC.
30.
In
Sathiyamoorthy v. State
, 2014(3) R.C.R.(Criminal) 867, after observing that after the
compromise they have been staying peacefully in the village. It is in the interest of both sides
to bury the hatchet and lead a peaceful life, Hon'ble Supreme Court holds,
           [6]. Offences under Sections 341 and 325 are compoundable. In view
           of the settlement they can be permitted to be compounded.
           However, offences under
Sections 148
and
149
of the IPC are not
           compoundable. Hence, permission to compound them cannot be
           granted. However, since the accused and the victim have entered into
           a compromise, we feel that it would be in the interest of both sides to
           reduce the sentence awarded to the accused under
Sections 325
and
341
of the IPC to the sentence already undergone.
[7]. In Ram Lal and anr. v. State of J & K, 2000(1) R.C.R.(Criminal) 92 :
(1999)2 SCC 213 the accused were convicted for offence under
Section 326
of the IPC, which is non-compoundable. Looking to the
           fact that the parties had arrived at a settlement and victim had no
           grievance, this Court reduced the sentence for the offence under
           Section 326 to sentence already undergone by the appellants-
accused. We are inclined to follow similar course.
8. In the result, the appeal is partly allowed. The offences under
Sections 341
and
325
of the IPC, for which the appellants are
           convicted, are permitted to be compounded because they are
           compoundable. The appellants are acquitted of the said offences. The
           appellants are stated to have undergone more than six months
           imprisonment. So far as offences under
Sections 148
and
149
of the
           IPC are concerned, the conviction of the appellants for the said
           offences is reduced to the sentence already undergone by them

In
Deva Ram v. State of Rajasthan
, (2014) 13 SCC 275, the appellant was convicted by
Trial Court under
section 420
IPC. His appeal against conviction was dismissed by the Sessions
Court and revision petition was also dismissed by High Court. The convict approached the
Apex Court and Hon'ble Supreme Court held,
           [5]. We are informed that out of two years imprisonment the
           appellant has undergone six months imprisonment. Offence under
Section 420
of the IPC is compoundable with the permission of the
           court by the person who is cheated. Since the parties are related to
           each other and they have decided to accord a quietus to their
           disputes and live peacefully, we permit them to compound the
           offence. Hence, the offence under
Section 420
of the IPC for which
           the appellant was convicted is compounded because it is
           compoundable with the permission of the court. The appellant is
           acquitted of the said charge.

In
Shankar Yadav v. State of Chhattisgarh, Cr.A
982 of 2017 Law Finder Doc Id # 877762,
Hon'ble Supreme Court while permitting post-conviction compromise, by holding the offence
to fall under
section 324
IPC, held,
             [8]. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we see
             no reasons to refuse permission to the parties who have
             compromised the offences which were compoundable under the
             Code as it stood in 1998. If it is so, compounding can be permitted
             and the appellants-accused can be acquitted in view of
Section 320
             (8)
of the Cr.P.C., which expressly enacts that where the composition
             of an offence under this section is recorded by the court, it shall have
             effect of an acquittal of the accused with whom the offence has been
             compounded. We order accordingly.

In
Sube Singh v. State of Haryana
, 2013 (4) RCR (Cri) 102, a Division Bench of this Court
holds,
             [17]. The magnitude of inherent jurisdiction exercisable by the High
             Court under
Section 482
Criminal Procedure Code with a view to
             prevent the abuse of law or to secure the ends of justice, however, is
             wide enough to include its power to quash the proceedings in
             relation to not only the non-compoundable offences notwithstanding
             the bar under
Section 320
Criminal Procedure Code but such a power,
             in our considered view, is exercisable at any stage save that there is
             no express bar and invoking of such power is fully justified on facts
             and circumstances of the case.
[21]. In the light of these peculiar facts and circumstances where not
             only the parties but their close relatives (including daughter and son-
             in-law of respondent No. 2) have also supported the amicable
             settlement, we are of the considered view that the negation of the
             compromise would disharmonize the relationship and cause a
             permanent rift amongst the family members who are living together
             as a joint family. Non-acceptance of the compromise would also lead
             to denial of complete justice which is the very essence of our justice
             delivery system. Since there is no statutory embargo against invoking
             of power under
Section 482
Criminal Procedure Code after conviction
             of an accused by the trial Court and during pendency of appeal
             against such conviction, it appears to be a fit case to invoke the
             inherent jurisdiction and strike down the proceedings subject to
             certain safeguards.

In
Maya Sanjay Khandare v. State of Maharastra
, 5-1-2021, Bom, 2021 (1) RCR(Cri) 450,
a three-member bench of Bombay High Court observed as follows:
(A) In a prosecution which has culminated in a conviction, whether
             the power
u/s 482
Cr.P.C. ought to be exercised for quashing the
             prosecution/conviction altogether, (instead of maintaining it and
             considering the issue of modification of the sentence) upon a
             settlement between the convict and the victim/complainant?

CRR No.2594 of 2013                                                               --9--
[33] While answering Question (A) we may observe in the light of the
           settled legal position as under :
At the conclusion of the criminal trial the Court on finding the
           evidence on record led by the prosecution to be sufficient to prove
           the guilt of the accused would proceed to convict the accused. The
           remedy of challenging the order of conviction is available to the
           accused by way of an appeal. Any compromise entered into post-
           conviction for a non-compoundable offence cannot by itself result in
           acquittal of the accused. Similarly, the Court has no power to
           compound any offence that is non-compoundable and not permitted
           to be compounded under Section 320 of the Code. The compromise
           entered into therefore is just a mitigating factor that can be taken into
           account while hearing the appeal/revision challenging the conviction
           and which factor has to be taken into consideration while imposing
           appropriate punishment/sentence. It is not permissible to set aside
           the judgment of conviction at the appellate/revisional stage only on
           the ground that the parties have entered into a compromise. In a
           given case the appellate Court/revisional Court also has the option of
           not accepting the compromise. Thus if the judgment of conviction
           cannot be set aside in an appeal/revision only on the ground that the
           parties have entered into a compromise similar result cannot be
           obtained in a proceeding under Section 482 of the Code.
           Hence, we hold that ordinarily the contention that the convict and
           the informant/complainant have entered into a compromise after the
           judgment of conviction can be raised only before the
           appellate/revisional Court in proceedings challenging such conviction.
           It would be a sound exercise of discretion under Section 482 of the
           Code and in accordance with the law of the land to refuse to quash
           criminal proceedings post-conviction for a non-compoundable
           offence only on the ground that the parties have entered into a
           compromise. Instead the Court can permit the convicted party to
           bring to the notice of the appellate/revisional Court the aspect of
           compromise.
Having said so, it is only in rarest of rare cases that the
           Court may quash the criminal proceedings post-conviction for a non-
           compoundable offence on settlement between the convict and the
           informant/complainant. To illustrate, where a jurisdictional issue
           going to the root of the matter is raised for challenging the conviction
           or in matrimonial disputes where the parties have agreed to settle
           their differences, jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code could be
           exercised. Such exercise of jurisdiction should be limited to the rarest
           of rare cases when found necessary to prevent the abuse of the
           process of the Court or to secure the ends of justice. Thus while
           holding that inherent power under Section 482 of the Code could be
           exercised for quashing criminal proceedings even at the
           appellate/revisional stage as held in Kiran T. Ingale[(
Kiran Tulshiram
           Ingale vs. Anupama P. Gaikwad and Ors.
, 2006 2 MhLJ(Cri) 402)] such
           exercise of jurisdiction should be limited to the extent stated
           hereinabove.
The ratio of the decision in
Kiran T. Ingale
(supra) has to
           be applied subject to aforesaid limitations. Further, the expression
           "criminal proceedings" would cover the entire journey of the
           proceedings commencing from its initiation till the proceedings
           culminate giving it seal of finality. Question (A) is answered
           accordingly.

Supreme Court observed that the finest hour of Justice arises propitiously when parties, who
fell apart, bury the hatchet and weave a sense of fellowship or reunion.
37.   This Court has inherent powers under
Section 482
of the Code of Criminal Procedure to
interfere in this kind of matter.
38.   In the entirety of the case and judicial precedents, I am of the considered opinion that
the continuation of these proceedings will not serve any fruitful purpose whatsoever. Given
above, because of the compromise, and in the facts and circumstances peculiar to this case
the above captioned judgment of conviction and sentence, charges, and FIR, are hereby set
aside qua the petitioners. However, the fine amount is forfeited to the State as cost incurred
by it. The bail bonds of the petitioners are accordingly discharged. All pending application(s), if
any, stand closed.
Petition stands allowed to the extent above. All the pending miscellaneous

applications, if any, stand disposed of.
