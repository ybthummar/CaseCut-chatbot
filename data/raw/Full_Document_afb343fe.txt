bank statements with signature marked as Ext. 26 and 26/1

5.      On the other hand, learned counsel for the State has
opposed the prayer for bail. It is submitted that the appellant-
Mahesh Kumar Poddar along with four others namely Sonu
Kumar Mahto, Pradip Mazumdar, Mantosh Kumar Poddar and
Ritesh Kumar have been rightly convicted by the learned Court
blow. It is submitted that co-convict, Sonu Kumar Mahato was
having found dubious bank account, which was verified and
proved by Sanjay Kumar Sinha, Branch Manager, Indian Bank,
Jamshedpur and thereafter Pradip Mazumdar, Mantosh Kumar
Poddar were arrested and the name of the appellant Mahesh
Kumar Poddar has come in this case on the basis of confessional
statement of co-convict Pradip Mazumdar. It is submitted that co-
convict Pradip Mazumdar is the mastermind of the entire crime
and the appellant- Mahesh Kumar Poddar happens to be the
associate of the said Mantosh Kumar Poddar and Pradip
Mazumdar and Sonu Kumar Mahato and it is evident from the
confessional statement of co-convicts Pradip Mazumdar and Sonu
Kumar Mahato marked as Ext.-14 and Ext. 11 respectively. It is
submitted that series of documents i.e. 16 ATM Cards, nine
passbooks of different banks, five mobile phones, 43 PAN cards,
16 SIM cards, cheque books, various I.D. proofs etc. have been
6
recovered from the possession of co-convict Sonu Kumar Mahato
and Pradip Mazumdar respectively and all these above documents
fully established the involvement of the present appellant -
Mahesh Kumar Poddar along with four others namely Sonu
Kumar Mahato, Pradip Mazumdar, Mantosh Kumar Poddar and
Ritesh Kumar in cheating the general people. It is submitted that
the appellant during his statement recorded under Section 313 of
the Cr. P. C., has also admitted that the bank account belongs to
him, however the appellant could not give proper reply from
which source sum of Rs. 21,85,037/- had come from the different
accounts holders and which was credited in the account of the

supported the prosecution case. It is submitted that P.W.-9 is the
I.O. of this case and who has brought on record Ext. 26 and 26(1)
respectively, which are the bank account statements of the

Evidence Act, which go to prove the guilt.
It is submitted that the appellant has got several criminal
antecedents and he is involved in cyber crimes in five cases of
cyber crime and two-three cases were earlier instituted and two
cases have been instituted now against him. It is submitted that
P.W.-9, Upendra Kumar Mahato, I.O. has stated that sum of more
than Rs. Twenty (20) Lakh had been withdrawn by the appellant. It
is submitted that the appellant has failed to show as to how the
said amount of Rs. 21,85,037/- has been received in his bank
account and as such prayer for bail of the appellant is fit to be
rejected.
6.      Perused the Lower Court Records of this case and
considered the submissions of both the sides.
7
7.      The present appeal has been heard along with Criminal
Appeal (S.J.) No. 493 of 2021, however, the order is being passed
separately today i.e. on 13.05.2022.
8.       It transpires from the FIR that in the light of E-mail
received from the Bank Manager, Noida Branch on 27.01.2020
and on suspicion by one of the bank employee i.e. P.W.-4, Alok
Mukhi, the co-convict, Sonu Kumar Mahato was apprehended and
he was interrogated on 06.02.2020 the bank account of one Sonu
Kumar Mahato was freezed. Thereafter Sonu Kumar Mahato was
taken into custody. Thereafter, on the basis of confessional
statement of Sonu Kumar Mahto, the name of other co-accused
Pradip Mazumdar and Mantosh Kumar Poddar had come in this
case and there after confessional statement of both the co-convicts
namely Pradip Mazumdar and Mantosh Kumar Poddar was
recorded on 07.02.2022 vide Ext. 14 and Ext. 16 and who have
named the appellant and his associates.
9.      It transpires from the impugned judgment passed by the
learned Court below that the name of the appellant has come on
the basis of confession of co-convict Mantosh Kumar Poddar.
From going through the evidence of P.W.-9, Upendra Kumar
Mahato, I.O. of this case, it transpires that the appellant has been
arrested on 06.06.2020.
10.     During cross-examination of the I.O., I. O has not been
confronted by the appellant that as to how Rs. 21,85,037/- has
been credited and the amount of more than Rs. 20,000,00/- had
been withdrawn. Silence of the accused under Section 313 of the
Cr. P. C. may be fatal to him, if he fails to rebut specific evidence
of availability of Rs. 21,85,037/- brought before him and if the
accused failed to rebut the presumption of availability of Rs.
21,85,037/- and the amount of more than Rs. 20,000,00/- had been
withdrawn, which may go against him.
8
11.       It also transpires from perusal of the Lower Court Records
that the Co-ordinate Bench in B. A. No. 10504 of 2020 vide order
dated 06.01.2021 directed the learned Court below to conclude the
trial within six months from the date of receipt of the copy of the
order.
12.       The Trial Court has meticulously dealt with all the
documents and Exhibits and also the Material Exhibits, which is
appreciated by this Court also.
13.       It also appears to be a case of negligence on the part of
two districts of police due to which two persons namely Ritesh
Kumar and Mahesh Kumar Poddar could not be arrested as Senior
Police officials had not properly supervised and had not instructed
the I.O. during investigation. I.O. i.e. P.W. 9 should have been
instructed to make proper investigation under the supervision of
Superintendent of Police or D.I.G. or any other superior authority.
I. O. has stated during his cross- examination at para-78 that
several passbooks were opened in the fake name and the victims
were not examined by the police. So far as other victim, from
whose account, amounts were debited, could not be examined.
There was lack of co-ordination between the police department and
I.T. Department dealing in cyber crime matters.
14.       The appellant has admitted his bank account during his
statement under Section 313 of the Cr. P. C. and therefore,
withdrawal of more than of Rs. Twenty (20.00) lakh, from his
bank account, which has been proved by            Ext. 26 and 26/1
respectively, will show that the appellant has got information of
availability of the said amount. The appellant has credited more
than sum of Rs. 21,85,037/- (Rs. Twenty One Lakh Eighty Five
Thousand and Thirty Seven only) from the people, which is a huge
amount.
15.       It further transpires that four (4) other cases i.e. Cyber
9
Crime Case No. 01/2020, 02/2020, 05/2020 and 28/2020 are
pending apart from this case against the appellant, therefore,
allowing the bail to the appellant at this stage may also affect the
trials and the Appellant may tamper and influence the evidence of
the witnesses of other cyber crime cases.
16.            In view of the judgment reported in 2019 (14) SCC 438 in
the case of Prahlad Versus State of Rajasthan, it transpires that the
silence of the accused persons and mere denial of the accused
persons in such a matter wherein he is expected to come out with
an explanation, leads to an adverse inference against him while
being examined under Section 313 of the Cr. P.C. may leads to an
adverse inference against the accused person, then the Court may
draw adverse inference against the accused person.
The appellant- Mahesh Kumar Poddar could not rebut the
evidence of receiving Rs. 21,85,037/- in his bank account and he
has admitted during his examination under Section 313 of the Cr.
P. C. that            account number 008901563677 of I.C.I.C.I. Bank,
Bistupur Branch, Jamshedpur belongs to him and as such the
learned Court below has convicted after taking into consideration
his answer given under Section 313 of the Cr. P. C. and which has
been supported by the judgment reported in 2019 (14) SCC 438 in
the case of Prahlad Versus State of Rajasthan.
17.            Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, I am
not inclined to enlarge the appellant on bail at this stage and as
such the prayer for bail of the Appellant is rejected.
However, the appellant may renew his prayer for bail after
completing half of the sentence.
18.            Accordingly, I.A. No. 3494 of 2022 stands rejected and
disposed of.
