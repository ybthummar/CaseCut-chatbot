quashing the order, vide which Gurmit Ram Rahim has been

ordered to be released on furlough by the respondent-State,

especially during when Assembly Elections in Punjab were

scheduled for 20.02.2022.
[2].    The present petition was filed on 11.02.2022 and the

same was re-filed on 14.02.2022 after removing some

objections. The matter came up for hearing on 18.02.2022.

Notice of motion was issued on that day with notice re:stay. The

case was ordered to be listed on 21.02.2022. On 21.02.2022,

the case could not be heard as the same was assigned to an

earmarked State counsel. The case was adjourned to

23.02.2022. On the adjourned date, the case was argued by

learned counsel for both the sides to some extent and

thereafter, learned counsel for the petitioner sought time to

supplement his arguments on the basis of precedents. The case

was finally argued before this Court on 25.02.2022 and the

order was kept reserved.
[3].    Learned      counsel            for   the   petitioner   vehemently

submitted that    respondent No.11 is undergoing sentence in

rape case as well as in murder case. He falls under the category

of hardcore prisoner and has not completed the requisite period

for grant of furlough. His release on furlough soon before the

Assembly Elections in Punjab is an act of mala fide in order to

Prisons, Haryana vide letter No.4885 dated 21.01.2022 had

requested the Additional Chief Secretary, Jail Department to

obtain opinion of learned Advocate General, Haryana as to

whether convict Gurmit Ram Rahim is entitled for parole in view

of his involvement in number of cases. The pointed reference

was whether Gurmit Ram Rahim falls under the category of

hardcore prisoner as per Section 2(aa)(i)(8) of the Haryana

Good Conduct Prisoner (Temporary Release) Amendment Act,

2013. For ready reference

[7].    Office of Advocate General, Haryana gave its opinion to

the Government that offence of criminal conspiracy punishable

under
Section 120-B
IPC has not been mentioned anywhere in
Section 2(aa)(i)(8)
of the Act which defines "serial killing'. The

term used in this provision is 'murder' simpliciter and no other

offence is mentioned anywhere. It clearly indicates that the

Legislation has intended to cover only the 'actual killer' under

the definition of 'hardcore prisoner' and not the 'conspirator'. In

order to cover a prisoner under the definition of 'hardcore

prisoner', it is necessary that he must have participated in actual

commission of the substantive offence of murder under
Section

302
IPC and the aiding offence of criminal conspiracy under

Section 120-B read with
Section 302
IPC will not be covered

under the category of 'hardcore prisoner'. Keeping in view the

factual and legal position mentioned above, the prison

authorities may consider the representation of Gurmit Ram

Rahim for the grant of parole on the grounds mentioned therein

as per norms. The opinion given by learned Advocate General,

Haryana was forwarded to the Director General, Haryana for

further necessary action. On receipt of information of learned

Advocate General, Haryana, Director General of Prison,

Haryana vide letter No.5350 dated 27.01.2022 forwarded the

same to the Superintendent, District Jail, Rohtak for further

necessary action. By that time, Gurmit Ram Rahim had

completed 6 years, 1 month and 20 days of sentence including

remissions and therefore, on 31.01.2022, Gurmit Ram Rahim

filed an application to Superintendent District Jail, Rohtak for

grant of three weeks furlough to meet his family members.

[8].    In view of opinion furnished by the office of Advocate

General, Haryana, the Superintendent, District Jail, Rohtak vide

letter No.488-91 dated 31.01.2022, initiated the process and

sent the same to the concerned authority i.e. District Magistrate,

Gurugram and Commissioner Rohtak Division, Rohtak for

consideration as per provision of
Section 4
of Haryana Good

Conduct Prisoner (Temporary Release) Act, 1988. For ready

reference,
Section 4
of the Haryana Good Conduct Prisoners

(Temporary Release) Act, 1988 is reproduced hereasunder:-
"4.1 The State Government or any other officer
           authorized by it in this behalf may, in consultation with
           such other officer as may be appointed by the state
           Government, by notification, and subject to such
           conditions and in such manner as may be prescribed,

           been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less
           than four years and who-

(b)    has not during such period committed any jail
           offence (except an offence punished by a warning) and
           has earned at least three annual good conduct
           remission;
provided that nothing herein shall apply to a prisoner
           who-
(i)    is a habitual offender as defined in sub-section (3)
           of section 2 of Punjab Habitual Offenders (Control and
           Reform) Act, 1952; or
(ii)   has been convicted of dacoit or such other offence
           as the State Government may, by notification, specify.
           (2)    The period of furlough for which a prisoner is
           eligible under sub-section (1) shall be three weeks
           during the first year of his release and two weeks during
           each successive year thereafter.
(3)    Subject to the provisions of clause (d) of sub-

dated 07.02.2022 has granted 21 days furlough to convict

Gurmit Ram Rahim from 07.02.2022 to 27.02.2022. District

Magistrate, Gurugram vide his office order No.9036/P.B dated

07.02.2022 accepted two sureties (Rs.5 lacs each) for release

of Gurmit Ram Rahim on furlough. In this way, Gurmit Ram

Rahim was released from jail on furlough for 21 days from

07.02.2022 to 27.02.2022 and he was directed to surrender in

jail    premises    on     28.02.2022.        Petitioner   also   filed   a

representation dated 08.02.2022, which was received through

E-mail on 11.02.2022 by the competent authority.

[10].     Perusal of
Section 2(aa)(i)(8)
of Haryana Good Conduct

Prisoners (Temporary Release) Amendment Act, 2013 would

show that
Section 120-B
IPC is not included in
Section

2(aa)(i)(8)
of the Act as amended till date. Furlough is granted in

long term imprisonment only i.e. in cases where sentence is not

less than 4 years. First furlough exceeds to 21 days and

thereafter, maximum for 14 days. Furlough can be granted only

once in a year and the same is intended to break the monotony

of imprisonment and no specific reasons to be given for grant of

furlough.

Bhagwan     Asaram         @       Asumal     Harpalani   decided     on

20.10.2021 has formulated broad principles for parole and

furlough and the same are enumerated hereasunder:-
"(i) Furlough and parole envisage a short-term temporary
          release from custody;
(ii) While parole is granted for the prisoner to meet a
          specific exigency, furlough may be granted after a
          stipulated number of years have been served without any
          reason;
(iii) The grant of furlough is to break the monotony of
          imprisonment and to enable the convict to maintain
          continuity with family life and integration with society;
(iv) Although furlough can be claimed without a reason,
          the prisoner does not have an absolute legal right to
          claim furlough;
(v) The grant of furlough must be balanced against the
          public interest and can be refused to certain categories
          of prisoners."
[12].   In the instant case, main thrust of the petitioner is that

Gurmit Ram Rahim being convict in rape case qua prosecutrix-A

and prosecutrix-B is undergoing sentence of 10 years each

consecutively. He is also involved in two more murder cases

and therefore, he falls under the category of hardcore prisoner.

[13].   On the other hand, learned State counsel and learned

counsel for respondent No.11 on the strength of definition as

amended by
Haryana Good Conduct Prisoners (Temporary

Release) Amendment Act, 2013
submitted that Gurmit Ram

Rahim is not convict of substantive offence under
Section

, rather he has been sentenced with the aid of
Section

120-B
IPC and his case does not fall in any of the sub sections

of
Section 2(aa)
of the           Haryana Good Conduct Prisoners

(Temporary Release) Amendment Act, 2013. Serial killing i.e.

murder under
Section 302
IPC in two or more cases in different

FIRs would not be attracted as conspirator is not directly

involved under
Section 302
IPC, rather he has been sentenced

for life with the aid of
Section 120-B
IPC. Sentence of life

imprisonment in two murder cases would start only after expiry

of his first sentence awarded in rape case i.e. 10 years

imprisonment each with fine of Rs.15,10,000/- for committing

offence    qua   prosecutrix-A and           prosecutrix-B and   these

sentences are to run consecutively in the first case decided by

Special Judge, CBI Court, Panchkula on 28.08.2017. The

sentences in murder cases have not started so far. The

interpretation of hardcore prisoner has to be appreciated in view

of subsequent convictions, therefore, status of Gurmit Ram

Rahim at the threshold of definition in
Section 2(aa)(i)
of the Act

does not depend upon the fact whether subsequent sentences

have in fact started or not.
[14].     The Statute identifies an offence of murder simpliciter

and not a conspiracy to murder or abetment thereof. The

conviction of Gurmit Ram Rahim is not directly under Section

, rather the same is with the aid of
Section 120-B
IPC.

Had the intention of legislature been to include aiding offence

under
Section 120-B
IPC for the purpose of defining hardcore

prisoner, the language of Amendment Act of 2013 would have

been different altogether. It has been excluded in the definition

clause of hardcore prisoner. Cases of
Section 120-B
IPC are

consciously excluded and the Legislature was very much alive

to the situation, in which
Section 120-B
IPC has been excluded.

The words used in an Act cannot be used or interpreted loosely

and inappropriately, rather the same are to be given true

meaning, importance and are to be correctly and exactly used.

Sub
Section 8
of
Section 2(aa)(i)
of the Act used for serial killing

i.e. murder under
Section 302
IPC in two or more cases in

different FIRs would make it clear that except
Section 302
IPC,

no other section has been given any place, nor has the same

been discussed by the Legislature in its sub section. It would be

relevant to note that if there is an ambiguity or an omission in

words used by the Legislature, the authority or Court would not

go to its aid to correct the same. The scope and remedy lies

some where else, when the provision itself is challenged or

under interpretation of status. The Legislature has to be

interpreted in the manner to understand its true spirit and the

intention of the Legislature has to be read in the manner it is

Legislature, the reading should be together from the words

which are used. In certain enactments and policies, the

Legislature in its wisdom has included

heinous crime, for example in the guidelines for Premature

while giving definition of heinous crime,
Section 120-B
IPC is

specifically mentioned along with
Section 302
IPC. In case of
Amendment Act, 2013
, the words used are distinct and has to

be read in the manner as suggested by the Legislature. The

Court is not supposed to go to its aid to correct or make up the

deficiency for its convenience. True spirit of the Legislature has

to be read in the manner as is given by the Legislature.

Similarly, Government of Haryana in its premature policy dated

12.04.2002 has specifically mentioned
Section 120-B
IPC along

with
Section 302
IPC for definition of heinous crime. Under
Section 25
of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, a murderer is

disqualified from getting inheritance. Since the intention was to

include abettors also, the language clearly says-"A person who

commits murder or abets the commission of murder". Under

POTA 2002, there is a distinction between actual assailants and

the conspirator who is not the assailants. Different punishment

is prescribed under
Section 3(1)
of the Act for the actual doer

(death or life), but altogether different punishment under
Section

3(3)
of the Act for a mere conspirator (five years to

imprisonment for life). Since Haryana Good Conduct Prisoners

(Temporary Release) Amendment Act 2013 only mentions

murder under
Section 302
IPC, therefore, it means only murder

simpliciter under
Section 302
IPC and a person charged under

Section 120-B read with
Section 302
IPC will not fall within the

scope of the Statute in order to infer his inclusion under the

definition of hardcore prisoner.
[15].   Evidently, the Legislature in terms of
Section 2(aa)
of

the Amendment Act, 2013 has nowhere discussed even slightly,

remotely or combinedly
Section 120-B
IPC or offence of criminal

conspiracy in the whole Statute. The combination of other

Sections like Section 387 read with
Section 302
IPC, Section

387 read with
Section 307
IPC and Section 376 read with
Section 302
IPC can be seen apparently. The Legislature could

have used Section 302 read with
Section 120-B
IPC, but there is

no such combination shown in sub Section (8) of
Section

2(aa)(i)
of the Amendment Act, 2013.
[16].   On the other hand, words used 'serial killing' or

'contract killing' have been used to make it more clear for the

execution that the persons who are actually real culprits

committing murder should be put under the category of

CWP No.3008 of 2022(O&M)                            16
hardcore prisoner. If we read sub Section (9) of
Section 2(aa)(i)
where with offence under
Section 302
IPC, the word contract

killer has been used by the Legislature. If contract killer can be

interpreted, then the word conspirator could also have been

used by the Legislature in the language of sub Section (8) along

with
Section 302
IPC or with serial killer, but the same has not

been used by the Legislature.
[17].    Evidently, the intention of the Legislature would be to

restrain those convicts from release who after coming out or on

release, may again indulge in crimes like serial killing or in

contract killing in order to satisfy their psyche. The import or

construction of sections which are not part of Statute by way of

little interpretation, would be contrary to the provision of Statute

and thus unconditionally, the same would defeat the purpose of

Statute itself.
[18].    It is also settled proposition that if two possible and

reasonable constructions can be put upon a penal provision, the

Court must lean towards the construction, which exempts the

subject from penalty, rather than the one which imposed

penalty. In plain words, it is submitted that the view favourable

to the accused should be accepted. It will not be lawful to

proceed upon as assumption that the Legislature has made a

mistake. The Court must proceed on the footing that the

Legislature intended what it has said. Even in case of some

defect in the phraseology used by the Legislature, the Court

cannot aid the Legislature's defective phrasing or add and

amend or by construction make up the deficiency unless and

until, challenge is laid to the vires of such enactment.

[19].   The settled rule of construction of penal provisions is

that if there is a reasonable interpretation, which will avoid the

penalty in any particular case, the Court must adopt the

construction and if there are two reasonable constructions, the

Court must give the more lenient one and if two possible and

reasonable constructions can be put upon a penal provision, the

Court must lean towards the construction, which exempts the

subject from penalty, rather than the one which imposed

penalty. Reference can be made to

[20].   Perusal of the writ petition would show that the

petitioner of course pleaded that he has locus standi to maintain

the present writ petition. The pleadings are wanting at the

threshold as to how and in what manner, the Assembly Election

has been prejudiced, particularly when Gurmit Ram Rahim has

been ordered to stay in Gurugram only. Strict terms and

conditions were imposed qua his movements and his security

was constantly under close vigil of the police administration. For

want of particular details in the writ petition, no such finding can

be given as to how and in what manner, damage has been

caused to the election proceedings of the petitioner who has

also fought election from one of the political parties in Punjab.

[21].    Since Gurmit Ram Rahim was granted furlough for 21

days and he has completed the same and has returned to the

jail premises, therefore, at this stage, more or less, the writ

petition has become infructuous. In my considered opinion, the

respondent-State has rightly interpreted the import of Section

2(aa) of the      Haryana Good Conduct Prisoner (Temporary

Release) Amendment Act, 2013. Since the petitioner has not

laid any such ground of applicability of subsequent sentences

during currency of sentences under a rape case, therefore, it

would be appropriate for the State to consider all pros and cons

arising out of all the convictions for the purpose of further

furlough/parole, if any, in accordance with law.

[22].    For the reasons recorded hereinabove, this writ petition

is disposed of.
