3.   The petitioners and the victims have entered into an out of Court
compromise. They have annexed the copy of the compromise with this petition
as Annexure P-3.
4.   Subsequent to that, the petitioners have come up before this Court to
quash the judgment of Conviction and FIR, and in the quashing petition, the
victims have been impleaded as respondents.
5.   On the prayer of the parties in the present petition, the Court had
permitted the parties to appear before the concerned Court to record their
statements. As per the concerned Court's report, the victims, without any threat,
consented to the quashing of FIR and consequent proceedings.
ANALYSIS & REASONING:
6.   Despite the severe opposition of the State's counsel to this compromise,
the following aspects would be relevant to conclude this petition: -
a)   The accused and the private respondents have amicably settled the
     matter between them in terms of the compromise deed and the
     statements recorded before the concerned Court;
b)   A perusal of the documents reveal that the settlement has not been
     secured through coercion, threats, social boycotts, bribes, or other dubious
     means;
c)   The victim has willingly consented to the nullification of criminal
     proceedings;
d)   There is no objection from the private respondents in case present FIR
     and consequent proceedings are quashed;
e)   In the given facts, the occurrence does not affect public peace or
     tranquillity, moral turpitude or harm the social and moral fabric of the
     society or involve matters concerning public policy;
f)   The rejection of compromise may also lead to ill will. The pendency of
     trial affects career and happiness;
g)   There is nothing on the record to prima facie consider the accused as
     an unscrupulous, incorrigible, and professional offender;
h)   The purpose of criminal jurisprudence is reformatory in nature and to
     work to bring peace to family, and society;

i)         The exercise of the inherent power for quashing the conviction,
     sentence and all previous proceedings are justified to secure the ends of
     justice.
7.   The injured and all the accused had appeared before the Court of JMIC,
Malerkotla and had stated that they have entered into a compromise and that a
cross case pertaining to the same incident at the instance of the accused was
also registered and is pending quashing based on compromise. The parties
belong to the same village and must be living there for generations and might
continue to live, who knows for how long. In the closely-knit village community,
when the parties have buried their hatchets, the continuation of criminal
proceedings will not advance the reformative purposes of jurisprudence just for
the sake of deterrence.
JUDICIAL PRECEDENTS          ON    QUASHING       OF    CONVICTION       BASED   ON
COMPROMISE:
8. In Ram Pujan and ors. v. State of U.P., 1973 AIR(SC) 2418, a three-judge bench
of Hon'ble Supreme Court, based on the post-conviction compromise reduced
the sentence under
section 326
IPC to that of already undergone.
9.   In Ram Prasad and Another v. State of Uttar Pardesh, Cr.A Nos. 308-309 of
1980, decided on April 21, 1980, Hon'ble Supreme Court converted the
conviction from 307
IPC
to 324
IPC
and after that based on compromise,
accepted the compounding of offence under
section 324
IPC and acquitted the
appellants.
10.
In
Ramji Lal v. State of Haryana
, (1983) 1 SCC 368, Hon'ble Supreme Court,
in a matter arising against the conviction under
section 325
IPC, held,
           [5]. All the offences for which the appellants are
           convicted are compoundable and the compromise can be
           entered into with the permission of the court. Looking to
           the chastened attitude of the accused and the
           commendable attitude of the injured complainant, in
           order to restore harmony in the society, we accept the
           compromise. We grant permission to enter into the
           compromise and accept the same. We accordingly allow
           the appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence
           imposed on both the appellants. If they are on bail, their
           bail-bonds will be cancelled. If they are in jail, they will be
           released from the jail forthwith.

11.
In
Mohd. Rafi v. State of U.P.
, 1998(2) R.C.R.(Criminal) 455, Supreme Court,
the convict had gone to Hon'ble Supreme Court against his conviction by the trial
Court under
Sections 323
and
325
of IPC, which was upheld by Sessions and High
Court. After that, the convict and the victim entered into an out-of-court
compromise. Hon'ble Supreme Court analyzed the parties' affidavits filed in
support of the compromise and observed that parties had willingly and
voluntarily settled the matter. To maintain good relations, Hon'ble Supreme
Court granted permission to them to compound the said offenses and order the
acquittal.
12.
In
Surendra Nath Mohanty and another Vs. State of Orissa
, 1999 5 SCC 238.
These decisions indicate that the effect of compromise after conviction for a
non-compoundable offence has to be taken into consideration only for the
purpose of reducing the sentence and not for setting aside the conviction on
that count.
13. In Parameswari v. Vennila, (2000) 10 SCC 348, the appellants before
Hon'ble Supreme Court had been convicted under
Section 494
read with
Section
109
of IPC. After that, they arrived at a settlement with the complainant, in the
presence of panchayatdars of their village, and placed on record the duly signed
compromise, and parties filed a joint application for permission to compound
the offences. While observing that the offence involved was compoundable with
the wife's consent and permission of the Court, Hon'ble Supreme Court granted
permission to compound the offence, and resultantly the appellants stood
acquitted of the offence for which they have been held guilty.
14. In M.D. Balal Mian v. State of Bihar, 2001 AIR (SCW) 5190, out of three
convicts, one was convicted under
Section 376
IPC, and the other two were
convicted only under
Sections 325
&
323
of IPC. After the High Court confirmed
the conviction and sentence, all three convicts approached Hon'ble Supreme
Court. Although Hon'ble Supreme Court did not find any scope for granting
special leave by the convict challenging his conviction under
section 376
IPC,
however, granted the other permission to the other two convicts to compound
the offences under
Section 320 (8)
of the Criminal Procedure Code and acquitted
both of them.

In
Vuyyuru Ramachandra Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh
, 2001 AIR (SCW)
2396, the appellant had approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court against
upholding the conviction under
section 354
IPC. The victim of molestation came
to terms with the convict and applied to compound the offence. Hon'ble
Supreme Court allowed such application for compounding and resultantly
acquitted the appellant under
Section 320 (8)
of the Criminal Procedure Code.
16.
In
Ramachandra Singh v. State of Bihar
, 2003(10) SCC 234, Hon'ble
Supreme Court holds,


           [5]. We have heard learned counsel for the appellants
           and the state and taken into, consideration the fact and
           circumstances of the case. In view of the compromise it
           appears that grievance, if any, of the complainant
           Kamlesh Kumari Devi is over. Indeed in view of the
           compromise the accused appellants stand acquitted of
           the offence under
Section 323
Indian Penal Code. In such
           circumstances the sentence passed by the trial Court and
           maintained by the High Court deserves to be modified so
           far as offence under
Section 498A
Indian Penal Code is
           concerned.
[6]. The appeal is partly allowed. The conviction of
           appellant Nos. 1 and 2 under
Section 498A
Indian Penal
           Code is maintained, but the sentence of imprisonment
           passed on them for offence under
Section 498-A
is
           reduced to the period already undergone. In so far as
           appellant No. 3 is concerned, in our opinion, it will meet
           the ends of justice if he is dealt with under
Section 4
of
           the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, and released on
           probation of good conduct. The sentence of
           imprisonment passed on appellant No. 3 is set aside and
           it is directed that he shall be released on his entering into
           a bond with one surety in an amount of Rs. 5000/- to
           appear before the trial Court and receive sentence on
           being called upon during a period of one year and in the
           meantime to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
17.
In
K. Kandasamy v. K.P.M.V.P. Chandrasekaran
, (2005) 4 SCC 349, based on
the compromise, Hon'ble Supreme Court acquitted the appellants/convicts of
the offence under
Section 500
Indian Penal Code.
18. In Khursheed and others v. State of U.P, Appeal (crl.) 1302 of 2007,
decided on 28-9-2007, the appellants were convicted by Trial Court under
sections 325, 323 read with 34
IPC
. Their appeal against conviction was

CRM-M-15615-2022                                                               6
dismissed by the Sessions Court and revision petition was also dismissed by High
Court. The convicts approached the Apex Court and Hon'ble Supreme Court
held,
            [12]. An offence of causing grievous hurt punishable
            under
Section 325
IPC is covered by sub- section (2) of
            Section 320 of the Code. It is thus clear that an offence
            punishable under
Section 325
IPC is also compounded
            with the permission of the Court.
[13]. The parties have compounded the offences. As
            stated in the compromise deed, Gurfan Ahmad,
            complainant and his mother Kulsoom @ Bhoori (injured)
            did not want any action against the appellants (accused).
            The parties are neighbours, their houses are situated
            adjacent to each other and they have been living
            peacefully for last many years and there is no dispute
            among them. It is further stated that to continue sweet
            relationship and harmony, complainant side does not
            want to take any action against the accused. A prayer is,
            therefore, made to accept the compromise.
[14]. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case,
            and considering the Deed of Compromise and having
            heard learned counsel for the parties, in our opinion,
            ends of justice would be met if we grant necessary
            permission for compounding an offence punishable under
            Section 325 read with
Section 34
IPC as required by sub-
            section (2) of Section 320 of the Code. The offence
            punishable under
Section 323
IPC has already been
            compounded by the parties.
[15]. Sub-section (8) of Section 320 states that the
            compounding of offence under the section shall have an
            effect of acquittal of the accused with whom the offence
            has been compounded. The resultant effect of
            compounding of offences would be that the accused
            should be acquitted. In other words, once the offences
            have been compounded and the requisite permission is
            granted by the Court, the accused must be acquitted.
19.     In Dr. Arvind Barsaul etc. v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2008) 5 SCC 794,
after the conviction under
section 498-A
IPC, the victim wife and the convict
husband had compromised their disputes, and sought setting aside of conviction
based on the compromise. Hon'ble Supreme Court holds as follows,
            [10]. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length.
            The parties have compromised and the complainant Smt.
            Sadhna Madnawat categorically submitted that she does not
            want to prosecute the appellants. Even otherwise also, in the
            peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and in the interest
            of justice, in our opinion, continuation of criminal proceedings
            would be an abuse of the process of law. We, in exercise of our
            power under
Article 142
of the Constitution, deem it proper to

quash the criminal proceedings pending against the appellants
          emanating from the FIR lodged under
section 498A
Indian
          Penal Code. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.

In
Manoj &Anr. v. State of Madhya Pradesh, Cr. A No.
1530 of 2008,
Hon'ble Supreme Court, based on compromise, accepted the compounding of
the offence under
section 324
IPC and acquitted the appellants.
21.
In
Md. Abdul SufanLaskar v. State of Assam
, (2008) 9 SCC 333, based on a
compromise, Hon'ble Supreme Court set aside the conviction and sentence
under
section 324
IPC.
Hon'ble Supreme Court took similar views in
Mathura
Singh v. State of U.P.,2009
(13) SCC 420 and in GampaGovindu v. State of Andhra
Pradesh thr. Public Prosecutor, 2008 (sup) Cri. L.R. 440: Law Finder Doc Id #

22.
In
C.Muniappan Vs. State of Tamil Nadu
, 2009 13 SCC 790, after the
conviction and sentence under
section 302
IPC, the deceased's family had
compromised the matter with the accused. Rejecting the compromise, Hon'ble
Supreme Court observed that once the parties have settled their disputes, they
could live in peace, but that cannot be a ground to pass a judgment of acquittal.
23. In Gampa Govindu v. State of Andhra Pradesh, Law Finder Doc Id # 521064;
2008(1) OriLR839, Hon'ble Supreme Court holds,
          [3]. The Trial Court convicted the sole appellant under
Section 326
of the Indian Penal Code [hereinafter
          referred to as "
I.P.C
."] and sentenced to undergo rigorous
          imprisonment for a period of three years and to pay fine
          of Rupees one thousand; in default, to undergo further
          simple imprisonment for a period of one month. On
          appeal being preferred, the Sessions Court confirmed the
          conviction and sentence. When the matter was taken to
          the High Court in revision, the conviction and sentence
          under
Section 326
I.P.C. have been set aside and the
          appellant has been convicted under
Section 324
I.P.C. and
          sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period
          of one year. Before this Court, a joint petition of
          compromise has been filed wherein it has been stated
          that the parties have settled their disputes; as such, they
          be permitted to compound the offence. In our view, the
          prayer is just and must be granted. Accordingly, the
          criminal appeal is allowed and the conviction and
          sentence awarded against the appellant are set aside, in
          view of the compounding.

24. In HirabhaiJhaverbhai v. State of Gujarat, (2010) 6 SCC 688, permitting the
parties to compromise the conviction under
section 324
IPC, Hon'ble Supreme
Court holds, "The injured complainant and two other injured are permitted to
compound the offence punishable under
Section 324
Indian Penal Code. In view
of sub-section (8) of
Section 320
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the
composition of offence under
section 324
Indian Penal Code shall have the effect
of an acquittal of the appellant with whom the offence has been compounded."

In
Surat Singh v. State of Uttaranchal (Now Uttarakhand
), 2012(12) SCC
772, Hon'ble Supreme Court, based on compromise, permitted the parties to
compound their offences under
section 354
and
506
IPC.
26.
In
Jeetu Vs. State of Chhattisgarh
, 2013 11 SCC 489 it is the duty of the
appellate Court to arrive at its own independent conclusion after examining the
material on record. This exercise has however to be conducted after considering
the material on record. There is no power conferred by the Code either on the
appellate Court/revisional Court to acquit an accused convicted for a
commission of a non-compoundable offence only on the ground that
compromise has been entered into between the convict and the
informant/complainant.
27.
In
Dasan v. State of Kerala
, (2014) 12 SCC 666, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
converted the conviction from 326
IPC
to 325
IPC
and, based on compromise,
accepted the compounding of the offence under
section 325
IPC and acquitted
the appellant.
In
Padmalayan v. Sarasan
, (2014) 13 SCC 798, Hon'ble Supreme Court permitted
post-conviction compromise for offence under
section 324
IPC.
28.
In
Sathiyamoorthy v. State
, 2014(3) R.C.R.(Criminal) 867, after observing that
after the compromise they have been staying peacefully in the village. It is in the
interest of both sides to bury the hatchet and lead a peaceful life, Hon'ble
Supreme Court holds,
          [6]. Offences under Sections 341 and 325 are
          compoundable. In view of the settlement they can be
          permitted to be compounded. However, offences under
Sections 148
and
149
of the IPC are not compoundable.

Hence, permission to compound them cannot be granted.
          However, since the accused and the victim have entered
          into a compromise, we feel that it would be in the
          interest of both sides to reduce the sentence awarded to
          the accused under
Sections 325
and
341
of the IPC to the
          sentence already undergone.
[7]. In Ram Lal and anr. v. State of J & K, 2000(1)
          R.C.R.(Criminal) 92 : (1999)2 SCC 213 the accused were
          convicted for offence under
Section 326
of the IPC, which
          is non-compoundable. Looking to the fact that the parties
          had arrived at a settlement and victim had no grievance,
          this Court reduced the sentence for the offence under
          Section 326 to sentence already undergone by the
          appellants-accused. We are inclined to follow similar
          course.
8. In the result, the appeal is partly allowed. The offences
          under
Sections 341
and
325
of the IPC, for which the
          appellants are convicted, are permitted to be
          compounded because they are compoundable. The
          appellants are acquitted of the said offences. The
          appellants are stated to have undergone more than six
          months imprisonment. So far as offences under
Sections
          148
and
149
of the IPC are concerned, the conviction of
          the appellants for the said offences is reduced to the
          sentence already undergone by them subject to the
          appellants paying L 30,000/- as compensation to victim-
          Murugesan. Compensation be paid within three months
          from the date of this judgment.

In
Deva Ram v. State of Rajasthan
, (2014) 13 SCC 275, the appellant was
convicted by Trial Court under
section 420
IPC. His appeal against conviction was
dismissed by the Sessions Court and revision petition was also dismissed by High
Court. The convict approached the Apex Court and Hon'ble Supreme Court held,
          [5]. We are informed that out of two years imprisonment
          the appellant has undergone six months imprisonment.
          Offence under
Section 420
of the IPC is compoundable
          with the permission of the court by the person who is
          cheated. Since the parties are related to each other and
          they have decided to accord a quietus to their disputes
          and live peacefully, we permit them to compound the
          offence. Hence, the offence under
Section 420
of the IPC
          for which the appellant was convicted is compounded
          because it is compoundable with the permission of the
          court. The appellant is acquitted of the said charge.

, (2015) 8 SCC 286, Hon'ble Supreme Court,
in a matter arising out of conviction, permitted the compounding of offence
under

Shankar Yadav v. State of Chhattisgarh, Cr.A
982 of 2017 Law Finder Doc Id #
877762, Hon'ble Supreme Court while permitting post-conviction compromise,
by holding the offence to fall under
section 324
IPC, held,
[8]. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we see no reasons
to refuse permission to the parties who have compromised the offences which
were compoundable under the Code as it stood in 1998. If it is so, compounding
can be permitted and the appellants-accused can be acquitted in view of
Section
320 (8)
of the Cr.P.C., which expressly enacts that where the composition of an
offence under this section is recorded by the court, it shall have effect of an
acquittal of the accused with whom the offence has been compounded. We
order accordingly.

In
Sube Singh v. State of Haryana
, 2013 (4) RCR (Cri) 102, a Division Bench
of this Court holds,
           [17]. The magnitude of inherent jurisdiction exercisable
           by the High Court under
Section 482
Criminal Procedure
           Code with a view to prevent the abuse of law or to secure
           the ends of justice, however, is wide enough to include its
           power to quash the proceedings in relation to not only
           the non-compoundable offences notwithstanding the bar
           under
Section 320
Criminal Procedure Code but such a
           power, in our considered view, is exercisable at any stage
           save that there is no express bar and invoking of such
           power is fully justified on facts and circumstances of the
           case.
[21]. In the light of these peculiar facts and circumstances
           where not only the parties but their close relatives
           (including daughter and son-in-law of respondent No. 2)
           have also supported the amicable settlement, we are of
           the considered view that the negation of the compromise
           would disharmonize the relationship and cause a
           permanent rift amongst the family members who are
           living together as a joint family. Non-acceptance of the
           compromise would also lead to denial of complete justice
           which is the very essence of our justice delivery system.
           Since there is no statutory embargo against invoking of
           power under
Section 482
Criminal Procedure Code after
           conviction of an accused by the trial Court and during
           pendency of appeal against such conviction, it appears to
           be a fit case to invoke the inherent jurisdiction and strike
           down the proceedings subject to certain safeguards.

In
Maya Sanjay Khandare v. State of Maharastra
, 5-1-2021, Bom, 2021 (1)
RCR(Cri) 450, a three-member bench of Bombay High Court observed as follows:
10 of 13
::: Downloaded on - 01-10-2022 22:18:36 :::
CRM-M-15615-2022                                                        11
(A) In a prosecution which has culminated in a conviction,
         whether the power
u/s 482
Cr.P.C. ought to be exercised
         for quashing the prosecution/conviction altogether,
         (instead of maintaining it and considering the issue of
         modification of the sentence) upon a settlement between
         the convict and the victim/complainant?
[33] While answering Question (A) we may observe in the light of the
     settled legal position as under :
At the conclusion of the criminal trial the Court on finding
         the evidence on record led by the prosecution to be
         sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused would proceed
         to convict the accused. The remedy of challenging the
         order of conviction is available to the accused by way of
         an appeal. Any compromise entered into post-conviction
         for a non-compoundable offence cannot by itself result in
         acquittal of the accused. Similarly, the Court has no
         power to compound any offence that is non-
compoundable and not permitted to be compounded
         under Section 320 of the Code. The compromise entered
         into therefore is just a mitigating factor that can be taken
         into account while hearing the appeal/revision
         challenging the conviction and which factor has to be
         taken into consideration while imposing appropriate
         punishment/sentence. It is not permissible to set aside
         the judgment of conviction at the appellate/revisional
         stage only on the ground that the parties have entered
         into a compromise. In a given case the appellate
         Court/revisional Court also has the option of not
         accepting the compromise. Thus if the judgment of
         conviction cannot be set aside in an appeal/revision only
         on the ground that the parties have entered into a
         compromise similar result cannot be obtained in a
         proceeding under Section 482 of the Code.
Hence, we hold that ordinarily the contention that the
         convict and the informant/complainant have entered into
         a compromise after the judgment of conviction can be
         raised only before the appellate/revisional Court in
         proceedings challenging such conviction. It would be a
         sound exercise of discretion under Section 482 of the
         Code and in accordance with the law of the land to refuse
         to quash criminal proceedings post-conviction for a non-
         compoundable offence only on the ground that the
         parties have entered into a compromise. Instead the
         Court can permit the convicted party to bring to the
         notice of the appellate/revisional Court the aspect of
         compromise. Having said so, it is only in rarest of rare
         cases that the Court may quash the criminal proceedings
         post-conviction for a non-compoundable offence on
         settlement      between       the     convict     and    the
         informant/complainant. To illustrate, where a
         jurisdictional issue going to the root of the matter is
         raised for challenging the conviction or in matrimonial

disputes where the parties have agreed to settle their
          differences, jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code
          could be exercised. Such exercise of jurisdiction should be
          limited to the rarest of rare cases when found necessary
          to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court or to
          secure the ends of justice. Thus while holding that
          inherent power under Section 482 of the Code could be
          exercised for quashing criminal proceedings even at the
          appellate/revisional stage as held in Kiran T. Ingale[(
Kiran
          Tulshiram Ingale vs. Anupama P. Gaikwad and Ors.
, 2006
          2 MhLJ(Cri) 402)] such exercise of jurisdiction should be
          limited to the extent stated hereinabove.
The ratio of the
          decision in
Kiran T. Ingale
(supra) has to be applied
          subject to aforesaid limitations. Further, the expression
          "criminal proceedings" would cover the entire journey of
          the proceedings commencing from its initiation till the
          proceedings culminate giving it seal of finality. Question
          (A) is answered accordingly.

In
Yogendra Yadav v State of Jharkhand
, 21.7.2014, Supreme Court holds,
          [4]. Now, the question before this Court is whether this
          Court can compound the offences under
Sections 326
and
307
of the IPC which are non-compoundable. Needless to
          say that offences which are non-compoundable cannot
          be compounded by the court. Courts draw the power of
          compounding offences from Section 320 of the Code.
The
          said provision has to be strictly followed (
Gian Singh v.
          State of Punjab
, 2012(4) R.C.R.(Criminal) 543 : 2012(4)
          Recent Apex Judgments (R.A.J.) 549 : (2012)10 SCC 303).
          However, in a given case, the High Court can quash a
          criminal proceeding in exercise of its power under section
          482 of the Code having regard to the fact that the parties
          have amicably settled their disputes and the victim has no
          objection, even though the offences are non-
compoundable. In which cases the High Court can
          exercise its discretion to quash the proceedings will
          depend on facts and circumstances of each case.
          Offences which involve moral turpitude, grave offences
          like rape, murder etc. cannot be effaced by quashing the
          proceedings because that will have harmful effect on the
          society. Such offences cannot be said to be restricted to
          two individuals or two groups. If such offences are
          quashed, it may send wrong signal to the society.
          However, when the High Court is convinced that the
          offences are entirely personal in nature and, therefore,
          do not affect public peace or tranquillity and where it
          feels that quashing of such proceedings on account of
          compromise would bring about peace and would secure
          ends of justice, it should not hesitate to quash them. In
          such cases, the prosecution becomes a lame prosecution.
          Pursuing such a lame prosecution would be waste of time

In
Shakuntala Sawhney v Kaushalya Sawhney
, (1979) 3 SCR 639, at P 642,
Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that the finest hour of Justice arises
propitiously when parties, who fell apart, bury the hatchet and weave a sense of
fellowship or reunion.
35. This Court has inherent powers under
Section 482
of the Code of Criminal
Procedure to interfere in this kind of matter.
36. In the entirety of the case and judicial precedents, I am of the considered
opinion that the continuation of these proceedings will not serve any fruitful
purpose whatsoever. Given above, because of the compromise, and in the facts
and circumstances peculiar to this case the above captioned judgment(s) of
conviction and sentence, charges, and FIR, are hereby quashed qua the
petitioners. However, the fine amount is forfeited to the State as cost incurred
by it. The bail bonds of the petitionerS are accordingly discharged. All pending
application(s), if any, stand closed.
