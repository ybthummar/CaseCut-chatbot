Hon'ble Sudhanshu Dhulia, J. (Oral)
These writ petitions were disposed of by this
Court vide judgment and order dated 06.08.2018 by
directing the Cyber Crime Cell to complete its inquiry by
06.09.2018 and the decision to be taken thereafter by the
State Government on the report of the Cyber Crime Cell by
6
21.09.2018. It was further directed that in case the
inquiry is not completed by 06.09.2018, the petitioners
would be at liberty to seek refund of the amount deposited
by them as the earnest money.
2.        Since the inquiry could not be completed by
06.09.2018 and the amount was not released, an
application was filed by the State Government for
extension of time.
3.        Now these matters have been listed on time
extension applications.
4.        This Court has now been informed by the
learned State Counsel that the Cyber Crime Cell inquiry
has resulted in filing the final report in the matter and
there is nothing against the petitioners and the earnest
money deposited by the petitioners is liable to be released
and orders to this effect have already been passed.
5.        In view thereof, nothing further needs to be
done by this Court in the matter. No order needs to be
passed on the time extension applications. Let the amount
deposited by the petitioners as earnest money be returned
to them within a week.
