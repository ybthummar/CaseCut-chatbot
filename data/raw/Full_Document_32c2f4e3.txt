CW-1 never disclosed him that the accused had ever approached him for filing
another case. CW-1 informed him that both the above-mentioned cheques were
presented in the bank and were bounced. There were no talks between him and
the accused regarding presentation of the cheques. It is correct that no amount is
due from accused Rajan to him till date. CW2 has denied all the suggestions put

as duly filled and signed except the date. He had instructed the complainant to
inform him before presenting the cheque. He admits receiving of the legal
notice. He further stated that complainant has filed false case against him, and is
using his profession against him. A person namely Vijay Bhardwaj who he knew

thinks Vijay Bhardwaj and complainant had conspired against him. Accused has
opted to lead DE.
18.    Accused examined himself as DW1 and he deposed that in the year 2015,

to meet him and told him that the complainant has been engaged for a fee of
Rs.1,20,000/-. Vijay Bharadwaj told his wife that she gave him the money and
he will hand over it to the complainant.

payment of the legal fees was given to the complainant which was not in his
knowledge but was informed to him. Thereafter, he asked his wife whether the
payment is being made to the complainant through Vijay Bharadwaj. Then he
met the complainant personally and he told him that he had not received the
payment and then in front of him he called Vijay Bharadwaj. Thereafter, Vijay
Bharadwaj on his asking gave Rs.25,000/- or Rs.50,000/- to the complainant. In
the meantime, he understood that he was being cheated upon. Although the
complainant is a reputed Advocate and a nice gentleman. The complainant
demanded more money but he told the complainant that all the legal fees had
already been paid through his wife. Thereafter, complainant kept on demanding
the legal fees. Then he told the complainant that he wants to meet the person
namely Vijay Bharadwaj through which he had met the complainant.
20. DW1 further stated that He had even called the brother of the complainant
who is SI in Haryana Police. The complainant's brother also misguided him and
then he called Vijay Bharadwaj and he shouted him not to call again. In the car
of complainant, Vijay Bharadwaj on phone told the complainant and Sh.
Dharmender Kumar, Advocate, something which was not clear. Thereafter, the
complainant told him that accused makes the payment from his side and when
complainant would receive payment from Vijay Bharadwaj, he will return the
amount paid by accused. Then he paid the complainant Rs.50,000/- in cash in
instalments. When the case against him was at final stages, then he told the
complainant to file the defamation case for which he had issued two cheques to
the complainant which are the cheques in question which were undated cheques.

 But on 24.10.2017 the complainant had presented the first cheque amounting to
Rs.20,000/- in the bank. Then he called the complainant, who told that his son
filled the date on the cheque and presented it in the bank. Then on the second
cheque of Rs.10,000/- was also already filled by the complainant which includes
the date. They had put a date of 20.11.2017 on the second cheque and then
presented in the bank.

presented the first cheque amounting to Rs.20,000/-. Then in the night he called
the complainant and complainant threatened him and he also stated that we will
settle the matter in court. The main purpose for the cheques was for the
defamation case but the complainant misused his cheques by making some false
story regarding nonpayment of legal fees. Since last three years the complainant

one police station one Sl Hans Raj also noted that there is no dispute and mere
harassment. One Civil case in Dwarka court was also filed by the complainant

He did not register any complaint since the filing of this case in any court or

so as he had good relations with the complainant. He had not filed any
complaint against the complainant for filing a civil case against him. DW1

settle the same as it is a false case. The fact that Vijay Bharadwaj had threatened
him and brother of the complainant misguided him may have been mentioned in
his affidavit.

he used to have WhatsApp chat with the complainant. He cannot show the
WhatsApp chat as he had changed his number. He does not remember whether
he had received messages from the bank on the date of presentation of the
cheques as many messages keep coming daily and it is a technical issue. Vijay
Bharadwaj was the friend of his Palam friend and relative of the complainant.
The Palam friend namely Rekha lives in Mehram Nagar and currently he is not
in touch with her. His wife namely Dr. Shipra Jaiswal never used to visit Vijay
Bharadwaj at his home. He had not filed any documentary proof of transactions
with Vijay Bharadwaj. DW1 voluntarily deposed that he had made payment to
Vijay Bharadwaj through his wife which can be proved from his account
statement, if called upon by the court.

had never met Vijay Bharadwaj Rs.1,20,000/- was the legal fees as per his

28.    It has been argued by Ld. Counsel for the complainant that case of the
complainant is proved and cheque is also in the favour of the complainant,
therefore, accused must be convicted and amount should be recovered. On the
other hand, Ld. Counsel for accused has argued that accused has been falsely
implicated in this case and that complainant has not been able to prove its case
beyond reasonable doubt against the accused.
29.     I have heard Ld. counsel for the complainant and Ld. Defence counsel
for accused & considered the respective arguments as well as gone through case
file very carefully.
30.    The essential ingredients in order to attract
Sec. 138
of NI Act, 1881 are
as following:
i) The cheque for an amount is issued by the drawer to the
       payee/complainant on a bank account being maintained by him.
ii) The said cheque is issued for the discharge, in whole or in part
       of any debt or liability.
iii) The cheque is returned by the bank unpaid on account of
       insufficient amount to honour the cheque or it exceeds the
       amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement
       made with the bank.
iv) The cheque is presented within 3 months from the date on
       which it is drawn or within the period of its validity.
v) within 30 days a legal demand notice is issued by the payee or the
       holder in due course to the drawer of the cheque on        receipt of
       information by him from the bank regarding the dishonour of the
       cheque.
vi) The drawer of the said cheque fails to make payment of the
       said amount of the money as demanded in the legal demand
       notice to the payee or the holder in due course within 15        days
       of the receipt of said notice.
vii) The debt or other liability against which the cheque was
       issued is legally enforceable.
31.    Now, coming to the facts of the present complaint case keeping in view
the essential ingredients of
section 138
of NI Act. In this case, it is not disputed
and is admitted by the accused that both cheques bear his signatures and other

 particulars are also filled by him except the date. He also admits handing over of
cheque to the complainant. He also admits that he had instructed the
complainant to inform him before presenting the cheque. Therefore, it can be
said that the cheques were drawn by him in favour of the complainant.
Therefore, the essential ingredient (i) as discussed in the preceding paragraph
stands fulfilled.
32. Perusal of the reason on returning memo shows that both the cheques were
returned being funds insufficient and these documents speak for itself and
accused has not challenged those bank returning memos. Accused has not called
bank witness for challenging and rebutting these returning memos. No proof is
brought by the accused to show that he was having sufficient balance and these
returning memos are falsely created. It is pertinent to mention to here that
accused has neither denied the account number nor his name/signature
mentioned on the cheque. The dishonour of cheque is matter of record and
accused has admitted the said returning memo in statement of accused showing
fund insufficient in the account of the accused, hence, another essential
ingredients (iii) and (iv) also stand proved by the complainant.
33. Accused has admitted the fact of receiving the legal demand notice sent to
him by complainant in framing of the notice, statement of accused as well as in
DE and also stated that he had not reply the same. Also, as the accused has
appeared before the court and matter came in his knowledge and documents
were supplied to him after summoning, still accused chose not to reply back the
legal notice or to pay the due amount. Further, the accused had not explained
that what was stopping him to send the reply of legal notice of the complainant.
Moreover, the accused has not challenged the postal receipts.         So, it can be
rightly said that he has received the legal notice. Hence, essential ingredients (v)
and (vi) also stand proved.

34.    Now coming to the last and the remaining core ingredients (ii) and (vii) of
Section 138
of NI Act as discussed above and the real issue of controversy
herein i.e. whether the cheque in question was issued in discharge of any debt or
liability, whole or in part and whether the same is a legally enforceable debt.
35.    In this case, the statutory presumptions under
section 118(a)
and
139
would be raised in favour of the complainant regarding the fact that the
impugned cheques have been drawn for consideration and issued by the accused
in discharge of legally enforceable debt.
36.    It has been held by a three-judge bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the
case of
Rangappa vs. Sri Mohan
(2010) 11 SCC 441 that the presumption
contemplated under
Section 139
of NI Act includes the presumption of
existence of a legally enforceable debt. Once the presumption is raised, it is for
the accused to rebut the same by establishing a probable defence.
The principles
pertaining to the presumptions and the onus of proof were recently summarized
by the Hon'ble Apex Court in
Basalingappa vs. Mudibasappa
(2019) 5 SCC 418
as under:
"25. We having noticed the ratio
laid down by
this Court in the above
               cases on
Section 118(a)
and
139
, we now summarize the principles
               enumerated by this Court in the following manner:
25.1. Once the execution of cheque is admitted
Section 139
of the Act
               mandates a presumption that the cheque was for the discharge of any
               debt or other liability.
25.2. The presumption under
Section 139
is a rebuttable presumption
               and the onus is on the accused to raise probable defence. The standard
               of proof for rebutting the presumption is that of preponderance of
               probabilities.
25.3. To rebut the presumption, it is open for the accused to rely on
               evidence led by him or the accused can also rely on the materials
               submitted by the complainant in order to raise a probable defence.
Inference of preponderance of probabilities can be drawn not only
               from the materials brought on record by the parties but also by
               reference to the circumstances upon which they rely.
               25.4. That it is not necessary for the accused to come in the witness
               box in support of his defence.
Section 139
imposed an evidentiary
               burden and not a persuasive burden.

2025.05.29

                                                                                               +0530
                25.5. It is not necessary for the accused to come in the witness box to
               support his defence."
It is explicit in the
NI Act
that the said presumption shall remain untill
contrary is proved.
37.    With respect to the point of blank cheque/date raised by the accused, it is
pertinent to mention that
Section 20
of the NI Act talks about inchoate
instruments. As per this provision if a person gives a duly signed cheque which
is either blank or partly filled then he is deemed to have given implied authority
to the holder to fill up the particular in it and complete the cheque, thus making
the draw liable for the payment mentioned in it. It is immaterial that the cheque
may have been filled in by any person other than the drawer, when the cheque is
duly signed by the drawer. If the cheque is otherwise valid, the penal provision
of
section 138
would be attracted. At this stage, reference may be sought from
the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Bir Singh vs. Mukesh
Kumar
(2019) 4 SCC 197 wherein the Apex Court while upholding the validity
of blank signed cheque in a proceeding
u/s 138
of the Act has interalia held the
following:
"If a signed blank cheque is voluntarily presented to a
             payee,towards some payment, the payee may fill up the
             amount and other particulars. This in itself would not
             invalidate the cheque. The onus would still be on the accused
             to prove that the cheque was not in discharge of a debt or
             liability by adducing evidence."
38.    Perusal of the record shows that accused has corroborated with the case of
complainant during DE where the accused deposed that when he met
complainant personally, complainant told him that he had not received the
payment. In the cross examination, DW1/accused further deposed that
complainant kept on demanding the legal fees. Accused has not called Vijay
Bhardwaj in his support and to prove payment by the Vijay Bhardwaj to the
complainant. Moreover, it is admitted by accused that payment was made by his
wife through Vijay Bhardwaj. Even the accused has not called his wife into the
witness box to prove payment by her or facts told by his wife to him. Also, CW2

                                                                                                +0530
 also corroborated with the story of complainant by stating that he spoke with the
accused regarding fee after 21.07.2016 and asked him that why he is not paying
fees to complainant.
39.    Also, why the accused did not mention the date on the cheque if this was
given for the defamation case which was about to be filed in future. Therefore,
the complainant has successfully raised the doubt on the story of the accused
that this further defamation case by the accused is after thought for the present
case. Furthermore, accused could not justify his stance of defamation case
because on the one side, during DE, he stated that cheque in question was given
before the judgment in Rape case i.e during trial and on the other side, he stated
that it was given to file defamation case against the prosecutrix of Rape case.
This court fails to understand that how the accused perceived in advanced that
he will win the Rape case without judgment being pronounced and he will have
to file defamation case against the prosecutrix in future. Moreover, why the
defamation case against the prosecutrix was never filed, is also not explained.
Even it is not explained by the accused that if the cheques were given as
advance/token amount of defamation case then what was the total legal fees
agreed upon.
40.    Also, perusal of record shows that cheque returning memo shows that
reason of returning the cheque "funds insufficient". If the accused had given this
cheque earlier then also, he should have filed complaint before the bank or
police or before complainant or common acquitance regarding the possibility of
misuse of these cheques, which he had not, showing that accused was under
liability to pay the amount to the complainant.
41.    This court fails to understand the reason behind non filling of date in any
of the cheques. If the cheques were indeed handed over to the complainant for a
case, then why was date not written on them. No reasonable explanation has
been provided for this omission. Further, if the accused was not having any

                                                                                 SHARMA

liability, then what was the compelling circumstances for him to hand over his 2
filled cheques in question to the complainant when the one cheque would have
suffice. It is also found that not even a single cheque mentioned on its back that
this is an advance cheque against another case/defamation.
42. Accused has not deposed anything regarding the non-filing complaint
against Vijay Bhardwaj or against SI brother of the complainant, if both
threatened and misguided and not cooperated him. Also, if these cheques were
the advance/token cheque for filing of defamation case then also dates should
have been filed by the accused upon these. Accused claims cheques were meant
for a defamation case i.e it should be after acquittal on 30.11.2017, yet admits
cheques were handed over on 05.05.2017 (as per CW2), months before
acquittal. This is a clear contradiction and an afterthought by the accused. Also,
Accused neither filed any VakalaNama of defamation case, nor showed any
draft/plans/documents/WhatsApp        chats/call   recording   to   prove   that   a
defamation case was actually contemplated or initiated i.e he has failed to show
that complainant was engaged afresh for future purpose.
43. This court also found shifting stance of the accused. During DE, Accused
first said that Vijay Bhardwaj paid Rs 1.20 lakh, then says complainant
demanded money again, and he paid Rs. 50,000. If full payment was already
made, then why complainant was paid again and if paid extra then what step
accused took to recover the same. In addition to this, Evidence of CW2
remained unrebutted for the fact that the cheques were handed over in his
presence by the accused on 05.05.2017. Accused also agreed that cheque was
given prior to judgment. This date is contemporaneous with the main case trial
and fees being pending handed over by way of the cheques in question, not for
some later defamation matter. Further during DE, accused has stated that 80% of
payment of legal fees was given to the complainant, suggest that there was some
dues left.

44. It is also on record that even after filing a case the accused has not repaid the
cheque amount to the complainant and choose to contest the case. During the
case, he has failed to inform the ultimate date of the cheque payment. Also, no
document or witness or WhatsApp chat is produced by the accused to prove the
repayment (whatsoever) to the complainant and showing zero balance against
the accused. Further, no document or witness or WhatsApp chat or call
recording etc. is produced by the accused in support of his contention that
complainant has misused the cheque. No repayment slips or no repayment
message or no digital record of clearing all the dues towards the complainant is
filed by the accused for the perusal of the court and for his support. Even the
accused has not challenged or rebutted the deposition of the complainant.
45. As neither the effective cross examination of complainant was conducted by
the accused nor he has led effective DE. No doubt is raised upon the cheque
liability shown by the complainant. No doubt is raised upon the story deposed
by the complainant. Accused had not shown how and when he has repaid the
entire amount. Once the cheque is drawn in favour of the complainant, it was
the duty of the accused to keep money in his bank account to discharge his legal
liability against the complainant or if he has already paid the money, he should
ask the complainant in writing (documentary or through WhatsApp) to return
the cheque. However, as the accused has admitted himself that he had given the
cheque and complainant proved that cheque was given to repay the amount, also
sufficient to prove that cheque was issued in lieu of legal and enforceable debt.
46.    Non-discharge of the liability of cheque amount by the accused is not a
ground of acquittal without any evidence/witness/record etc. No repayment slip
is shown by the accused so as to suggest that he does not have this much
liability towards the complainant. Even accused could not prove that the total
agreed Legal Fees was only Rs. 1.20 Lakhs. No evidence is brought to the
notice of court to suggest that Vijay Bhardwaj and complainant had conspired

 against him ( as stated in SA). Mere verbal submission of the accused is no
evidence.
47. Accused has relied upon the judgment of
Bar of Indian Lawyers v D.K.
Gandhi
2024 SCC 430 and submits that non-payment to service of advocate
does not become legally recoverable debt under
NI Act
and only civil recovery
can be filed for legal fees and as advocate can not be liable under
Consumer
Protection Act
therefore accused can not be liable under
NI Act
. However,
undersigned does not agree with the accused. Legally enforceable debt (any) or
liability (other) encompasses obligations arising from valid contracts, including
professional fee agreements and services under personal contract. Therefore, the
exclusion of legal services from
Consumer Protection Act
does not negate the
enforceability of Lawyer's fee under
NI Act
. Moreover, NI Act deals with
credibility and enforceability of Negotiable Instrument and facilitating financial
transactions through bank/proper channel in fair manner.
48. In this case, Legal Fees for services rendered by an advocate/complainant
constitute a contractual obligation. Also, the advocate-client relationship is
fiduciary in nature and payment for professional service of advocate is a valid
legal liability. Further the cheque given by accused as payment for legal work
already done or to be done, amounts to consideration for services. Therefore,
the advocate/complainant has earned his professional fees which client/accused
is liable to pay and failure to pay the fees creates liability.
49.    On the aspects of preponderance of probabilities, the accused has to bring
on record such facts and such circumstances which may lead the court to
conclude either that the consideration did not exist or that its non-existence was
so probable that a prudent man would, under the circumstances of the case, act
upon the plea that the consideration did not exist.               As per the facts and
circumstances of this case accused has not led any cogent and believable
evidence to support his defence and has failed to rebut the presumptions.

50.    The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Rohitbhai Jivanlal Patel vs State of
Gujarat and Another 2019) 18 SCC 106 and in various other rulings have time
and again, emphasized that though there may not be sufficient negative evidence
which could be brought on record by the accused to discharge his burden, yet
mere denial would not fulfil the requirements of rebuttal as envisaged under
section 118
and
139
of the NI Act.
Further, it has been held in
Rajesh Agarwal
v. State
, 2010 SCC online Del 2501 that:-
"9. .....There is no presumption that even if an accused fails to bring out his
        defence, he is still to be considered innocent. If an accused has a defence
        against dishonour of the cheque in question, it is he alone who knows the
        defence and responsibility of spelling out this defence to the court and then
        proving this defences is on the accused....."
51.    Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the present case and the
settled position of law in this regard, the presumption of law as per
section
118(a)
and
section 139
of NI Act clearly come in picture for the favour of
complainant and his burden of proving the fact of issuance of cheque in
question in discharge of legally enforceable debt stands discharged and the
accused has miserably failed to discharge his reverse onus. Accordingly, the
ingredients mentioned at (ii) & (vii) of Para No. 30 of this judgment are also
fulfilled.
52.    In my view, the complainant has proved that the accused had issued the
cheque in question in his favour for discharge of the legally enforceable liability
and has proved his case against the accused for the offence under
Sec. 138
Negotiable Instruments Act. Resultantly, accused Rajan Kumar Sharma is thus,
held guilty and stands convicted for the said offence.                     Digitally signed by
